# kpopclassifier
Kpopclassifier was inspired by my utter confusion and curiosity over BTS' rise and popularity in the west. As a Korean who had his own phase of K-pop fandom (#BigBang4ever), I just could not understand what made them so unique. The explanation by western media did not assuage my perplexity, since their explanations have no actual backing through scientific validation.

This work is my way of explaning what other media platforms have not done, by using data science to mathematically explain the uniqueness of BTS, and what their musical identity actually is compared to other K-pop and American pop artists.
