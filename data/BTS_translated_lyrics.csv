0,euphoria,"

You’re the sun that rose again in my life
A reincarnation of my childhood dreams
I don’t know what these emotions are
Am I still dreaming?

This dream is a blue mirage in the desert
A priori deep inside of me
I’m so happy, I can’t breathe
My surroundings are getting more and more transparent

I hear the far-away ocean
Across the dream, over the horizon
I’m going to the place that’s getting clearer
Take my hands now
You are the cause of my euphoria

Euphoria
Take my hands now
You are the cause of my euphoria
Euphoria
Close the door now
When I’m with you I’m in utopia

Were you wandering around
Looking for an erased dream too?
It’s different from the typical definition of destiny
Your pained eyes are looking at the same place as me
Won't you please stay in dreams

I hear the ocean from far away
Across the dream, over the horizon
I’m going to the place that’s getting clearer
Take my hands now
You are the cause of my euphoria

Euphoria
Take my hands now
You are the cause of my euphoria

Even if the desert becomes cracked
No matter who shakes this world
Don't let go of the hand you're holding
Please don’t wake up from this dream

I hear the ocean from far away
Across the dream, over the horizon
(Please don’t wake up from this dream)
I’m going to the place that’s getting clearer
Take my hands now
You are the cause of my euphoria

Euphoria
Take my hands now
You are the cause of my euphoria
Euphoria
Close the door now
When I’m with you I’m in utopia

1,trivia-just-dance,"

If you ask me about that moment
Bright sunshine was falling down
If you ask me about that feeling
Naturally, it was a one shot into my eyes
Music playing in those vibes
We each stretch
Getting rid of the nerves
If I hid my heart, I would’ve regretted it
Watching this sunset with you
Hey, dance with me dance with me
Any kind of bounce is fine, dance with me
Where are you from, why are you dancing
A natural conversation, say something
It’s weird, we’re connecting too much
Feels like everything will go well
But you’re my Friend, yeah my Friend
Just
I like the feeling of being with you
I like the feeling of dancing with you
I just wanna, wanna, wanna
I really wanna, wanna, wanna
Just dance

To the rhythm of the music
However our bodies move
We’re shadows underneath the moonlight
Fall in.. fall in..

I like the feeling of being with you
I like the feeling of dancing with you
I just wanna, wanna, wanna
I really wanna, wanna, wanna
Just dance

In my muddy life
You were like a single stem flower
Even this suffocating studio
If we’re together, turns into paradise
My dreams that once had no answer
Now becomes something we can relate to
Because our rhythm is matching
Because we have our dance, it’s a fate-like beat
Let’s get it on POP
Washing me over with those waves
Our heartbeats are in sync
You’re getting to know my heart too
I wanna keep this going
I like you like I like to dance
So you’re my love, yeah my love
That’s what I like

I like the feeling of being with you
I like the feeling of dancing with you
I just wanna, wanna, wanna
I really wanna, wanna, wanna
Just dance

To the rhythm of the music
However our bodies move
We’re shadows underneath the moonlight
Fall in.. fall in..

I like the feeling of being with you
I like the feeling of dancing with you
I just wanna, wanna, wanna
I really wanna, wanna, wanna
Just dance

I felt it baby
This moment, you and me, baby
This all fits together like a math formula baby
Even obscurities, baby
Even difficulties, baby
Because of you, I’m comforted from all of that, baby

I felt it baby
This moment, you and me, baby
This all fits together like a math formula baby
Even rough breathing, baby
Even shedding sweat, baby
Because of you, it all has meaning, baby

I like the feeling of being with you
I like the feeling of dancing with you
I just wanna, wanna, wanna
I really wanna, wanna, wanna
Just dance

[Verse 1: V, Jimin]
You hide but only appear when you smile
Where did you come from?
Don’t lie, I know you’re an angel
What are you?

[Verse 2: Jungkook, Jin, Jimin]
But you
That smile is so cruel
Cruel
I shouldn’t have seen that cheek
You
What’s really dangerous
Is only in your possession

[Chorus: Jungkook, Jimin, Jin, V]
That dimple is illegal ille~gal
No, it’s dangerous, oh yes
So I call you illegirl ille~girl
Your existence alone is a crime
Was it a mistake made by an angel?
Or a deep kiss?
That dimple is illegal ille~gal
But I want it anyway anyway anyway

[Verse 2: Jin, Jungkook]
I don’t have it, only you have it
Is that why it’s so hard?
I wanna die fallen in you, I wanna die locked in you
You are my lake

[Pre-Chorus: Jungkook, V, Jimin, Jin]
Cause you
When you smile, I get dizzy
True
Please be careful
You
What’s really dangerous
Is only in your possession

That dimple is illegal ille~gal
No, it’s dangerous, oh yes

That dimple is illegal ille~gal
But I want it anyway anyway anyway

Every time I see you, my heart gets dangerous
Every time I see you, it gets more dangerous
Oh baby no hey
Oh baby no hey
You’re too dangerous to live in this world

That dimple is illegal ille~gal

3,trivia-love,"

Is this love
Is this love
Sometimes I know
Sometimes I don't
The next lyrics, um
What should I write, um
Too many words circle around me
But none of them feel how I feel
I just feel it
Like the moon rises after the sun rises
Like how fingernails grow
Like trees that shed their bark once a year
That you are the one who will give meaning to my memories
Who will make a 'person' into 'love'
Before I knew you
My heart was filled with straight lines only

I'm just a human, human, human
You erode all my corners
And make me into love, love, love
We're humans, humans, humans
In that myriad of straight lines
My love, love, love
When you sit on top of it and you become my heart

I live so I love
I live so I love
(Live & love, live & love)
(Live & love, live & love)
I live so I love
I live so I love
(Live & love, live & love)
(If it's love, I will love you)

You make I to an O
I to an O
Because of you
I know why human and love sound similar
You make live to a love
Live to a love
Because of you
I know why a person should live by love
It's a long way from I to U
Fuck, JKLMNOPQRST
I crossed all the letters and I reached you
Look, mine and yours also sound the same
Though that doesn't make me you
I want to be part of your bookcase
I'd like to be involved in your novel
As a lover

I'm just a human, human, human
You erode all my corners
And make me into love, love, love
We're humans, humans, humans
In that myriad of straight lines
My love, love, love
Sit on top of it and it becomes a heart

I live so I love
I live so I love
(Live & love, live & love)
(Live & love, live & love)
I live so I love
I live so I love
(Live & love, live & love)
(If it's love, I will love you)

What if I go?
If I go, would you be sad?
If I wasn't me, what would I be?
Do you think you'll leave me after all?

Wind, wind, wind blowing by
(I just hope not)
People, people, people that will pass by
(I just hope not)
My mood is blue, blue, blue
(In my head, it's blue from top to bottom)
How much I love you
How much, much, much

You're my person, my person, my person
You're my wind, my wind, my wind
You're my pride, my pride, my pride
You're my love (my love)
One and only love (only love)

You're my person, my person, my person
You're my wind, my wind, my wind
You're my pride, my pride, my pride
You're my love (my love)
One and only love (only love)

We wus lookin' for love
I was just one of those people
I did not believe what love was
I wanted to love like a habit

I will meet you and I will not be a book
Or did you take over my bookshelf?
Damn
Anyway, I want you the best man way
Probably because you were the world itself
If you die, you must die with me God I swore to myself
So many complex

You must finish me

5,singularity,"

[Verse 1]
A sound of something breaking
I awake from sleep
A sound full of unfamiliarity
Try to cover my ears but can’t go to sleep

[Pre-Chorus]
The pain in my throat gets worse
Try to cover it
I don’t have a voice
Today I hear that sound again

[Chorus]
It’s ringing again, that sound
A crack again on this frozen lake
I dumped myself into the lake
I buried my voice for you
Over the winter lake I was thrown

[Verse 2]
A thick ice has formed
In the dream I shortly went into
My agonizing phantom pain is still the same
Have I lost myself

[Pre-Chorus]
Or have I gained you
I suddenly run to the lake
There’s my face in it
Please don’t say anything

[Chorus]
Reach my hand out to cover the mouth
But in the end, spring will come someday
The ice will melt and flow away
Tell me if my voice isn’t real

[Chorus]
If I shouldn’t have thrown myself away
Tell me if even this pain isn’t real
What I was supposed to do back then

6,fake-love,"

[Intro: V, Jungkook]
For you, I could pretend like I was happy when I was sad
For you, I could pretend like I was strong when I was hurt
I wish love was perfect as love itself
I wish all my weaknesses could be hidden
I grew a flower that can’t be bloomed in a dream that can’t come true

[Hook: Jimin, Jin]
I'm so sick of this fake love, fake love, fake love
I'm so sorry but it's fake love, fake love, fake love

[Verse 1: RM, RM & Jungkook, J-Hope]
I wanna be a good man, just for you
I gave the world, just for you
I changed everything, just for you
But I dunno me, Who are you?
The forest just for us, you weren’t there
The route I took, I forgot
I even became quite unsure of who I was
Try babbling into the mirror, who the heck are you?

[Pre-Chorus: Jimin, Jin]
For you, I could pretend like I was happy when I was sad
For you, I could pretend like I was strong when I was hurt
I wish love was perfect as love itself
I wish all my weaknesses could be hiddenI grew a flower that can’t be bloomed in a dream that can’t come true

[Chorus: Jungkook, V]
Love you so bad, love you so bad
Mold a pretty lie for you
Love it’s so mad, love it’s so mad
Try to erase myself and make me your doll
Love you so bad, love you so bad
Mold a pretty lie for you
Love it’s so mad, love it’s so mad
Try to erase myself and make me your doll

[Hook: Jimin, Jin]
I'm so sick of this fake love, fake love, fake love
I'm so sorry but it's fake love, fake love, fake love

[Verse 2: RM, Suga]
Why you sad? I don’t know. I don’t know
Smile, say 'I love you'
Look at me, even I gave up on myself
Even you can’t understand me
You say I’m unfamiliar, changed into the one you used to like
You say I’m not myself which you knew well
No? What do you mean no? I’m blind
Love? What the heck is love? It’s all fake love

[Bridge: Jimin, Jin]
Woo, I dunno, I dunno, I dunno why
Woo, even I, even I don’t know myself
Woo, I just know, I just know, I just know why
Cuz it’s all fake love, fake love, fake love

[Chorus: Jungkook, Jimin]
Love you so bad, love you so bad
Mold a pretty lie for you
Love it’s so mad, love it’s so mad
Try to erase myself and make me your doll
Love you so bad, love you so bad
Mold a pretty lie for you
Love it’s so mad, love it’s so mad
Try to erase myself and make me your doll

[Hook: Jimin, Jin]
I'm so sick of this fake love, fake love, fake love
I'm so sorry but it's fake love, fake love, fake love

[Outro: Jimin/V, Jungkook/Jin]
For you, I could pretend like I was happy when I was sad
For you, I could pretend like I was strong when I was hurt

I wish all my weaknesses could be hidden
I grew a flower that can’t be bloomed in a dream that can’t come true

7,the-truth-untold,"

[Verse 1: V]
Full of loneliness
This garden bloomed
Full of thorns
I bind myself in this sand castle

[Verse 2: Jungkook]
What is your name
Do you have a place to go
Oh could you tell me?
I saw you hiding in this garden

[Pre-Chorus: Jin]
And I know
All of your warmth is real
The blue flower your hand was picking
I want to hold it but

[Chorus: Jimin]
It’s my fate
Don’t smile to me
Lie to me
Because I can’t get closer to you
There’s no name you can call me

[Post-Chorus: Jungkook]
You know that I can’t
Show you me
Give you me
I can’t show you a ruined part of myself
Once again I put a mask again and go to see you
But I still want you

[Verse 3: Jin]
Bloomed in a garden of loneliness
A flower that resembles you
I wanted to give it to you
After I take off this foolish mask

[Pre-Chorus: Jimin]
But I know
I can't do that forever
I have to hide
Because I'm a monster

[Chorus: V]
I am afraid
I am shattered
I’m so afraid
That you will leave me again in the end
Once again I put on a mask and go to see you

[Post-Chorus: Jungkook]
The only thing I can do
In the garden
In this world
Is to bloom a pretty flower that resembles you
And to breathe as the me that you know
But I still want you
I still want you

[Chorus: Jin]
Maybe back then
A little
Just this much
If I had the courage to stand before you
Would everything be different now

[Bridge: Jimin, Jungkook]
I'm crying
That’s disappeared
That’s fallen
Left alone in this sandcastle
Looking at this broken mask

[Outro: Jimin, Jungkook]
And I still want you
But I still want you
But I still want you
And I still want you

"
8,trivia-seesaw,"

It was a good start
In itself
Before I knew it, we were tired of each other
In all of these meaningless emotions

Repeated seesaw game
I'm tired of this
Repeated seesaw game
We're getting tired of each other

Were the petty arguments the start?
The moment I became heavier than you
Because there's never been parallels in the first place
Maybe I became more greedy and tried to fit in with you
Is there really a need to keep repeating ourselves
Saying this was love and this is love?
They're tired of each other, they seem to hold the same hand
Well, then

Alright, a repeating seesaw game
It's about time we put an end to it
All right, this boring seesaw game
Somebody has to get out of here
Though neither of us can

Don't let anyone know who'll get off first
Let’s not drag things out, however our hearts lead us
Are we getting out of here or not
This repeated seesaw game
We have to stop it now

People can be so crafty
They know they’ll get hurt if one person is missing
Because we don't want to be the villains
In the midst of a series of vague responsibilities
And we get so tired or if that we finally became parallel
But we didn’t want this kind of parallel

At first, we showed off who was heavier
We'd brag and smile
Now we're trying to beat each other
We're in a competition
The fire of a quarrel
It’ll only end if someone gets off right here
We’re acting like we’re comforting each other
But it’s mixed with thorns
Can’t keep doing this, we need to make a decision

If we didn’t have feelings for each other
If we didn’t think of each other
Would we have dragged it out like this?
Now if you don’t have any more feelings
This seesaw is dangerous
Stop thinking about me

Alright, a repeating seesaw game
It's about time we put an end to it
All right, this boring seesaw game
Somebody has to get out of here
Though neither of us can

(Hol' up Hol' up) I walk on this seesaw without you
(Hol' up Hol' up) Just like the beginning when you weren't here
(Hol' up Hol' up) I walk on this seesaw without you
(Hol' up Hol' up) I'm getting off this seesaw without you

Alright, a repeating seesaw seesaw game
It's about time we put an end to it
All right, this boring seesaw game
Somebody has to get out of here
Though neither of us can

Don't let anyone know who'll get off first
Let’s not drag things out, however our hearts lead us
Are we getting out of here or not
This repeated seesaw game
We have to stop it now

(Hol' up Hol' up) I walk on this seesaw without you
(Hol' up Hol' up) Just like the beginning when you weren't here
(Hol' up Hol' up) I walk on this seesaw without you
(Hol' up Hol' up) I'm getting off this seesaw without you

9,tear,"

[Verse 1: RM]
Goodbyes are, for me, a tear
Without even knowing, it blooms around my eyes
The words that I could not bring myself to say flow down
And lingering regret crawls over my face
To me, you were once my dear
But now you’re merely a bitter beer
My heart that’s stained with belated self-loathing
Becomes empty even with the passing breeze
At the end of my play where breakup was a lie
The price that I had to pay came to me
If someone said they would turn back the time for me
Would I have been able to be a bit more honest?
The bare face that only I know
The ugly and pathetic old friends within me
Would you still be able to love me again like before
With that smile with which you used look at me
Stop saying things like forever, forever
After all, the end originally exists
If there’s a start, I don’t wanna listen to that
Words that are too correct or too much consolation.. I don’t wanna listen to that
I was just so scared
Because it seemed like perhaps I had never loved you at all
Although it was late, that you were true
That only you loved me
More

[Chorus: RM]
You’re my tear
You’re my you’re my tear
You’re my tear
You’re my you’re my tear
You’re my tear
You’re my you’re my tear
What more can I say?
You’re my tear

[Verse 2: J-Hope, Suga]
We walked towards the same place
But this place becomes our last
Although we used to talk about forever
Now we break each other without mercy
Although we thought that we dreamed the same dream
That dream has finally become a dream
My heart is torn, please burn it instead
So that pain and regret, none of that would be left

[Chorus: RM, Suga, J-Hope]
You’re my tear
You’re my, you’re my tear
You’re my tear
You’re my, you’re my tear
You’re my fear
You’re my, you’re my fear
What more can I say?
You’re my...

[Verse 3: Suga]
Goodbyes are T.E.A.R
Because things like tears are a luxury
There’s no such thing as beautiful goodbyes
So just begin now
Woo take it easy slowly carve out my heart
That’s right, that’s right, gently step on the shards that have shattered
So that regret, regret, such a thing will no longer be left
Please burn up my heart that was torn into shreds
That’s right, right there, what are you hesitating for
This is the ending you were wishing for
So go on and kill me without hesitating
Woo yeah yeah burn it
Woo yeah yeah yeah burn it
Woo yeah yeah yeah burn it
So not even the ashes remain

[Verse 4: Suga]
This is the real you and this is the real me
Now we’ve seen the end and not even resentment is left
I’ve woken up from the sweet dream and I close my eyes
This is the real you and this is the real me

[Verse 5: RM, Suga]
We walked towards the same place
But this place becomes our last
Although we used to talk about forever
Now we break each other without mercy
Although we thought that we dreamed the same dream
That dream has finally become a dream
My heart is torn, please burn it instead
So that pain and regret, none of that would be left

[Chorus: RM, Suga, J-Hope]
You’re my tear
You’re my, you’re my tear
You’re my tear
You’re my, you’re my tear
You’re my fear
You’re my, you’re my fear
What more can I say?
You’re my...

[Bridge: Suga]
What should I say
We know
The answer is fixed
But replying is always hard

[Verse 6: J-Hope]
Why are you spilling it
Why are you tearing it up
It’s useless, to me
Goodbye to me is only those moments (Flashback)
The moment you say words from your mouth
The moment our focus becomes irregular
At the moment where everything is dangerous
Our end that two letters handed to us
That I won’t cry, that I won’t tear it up
I can’t say those kinds of words. In the future I, too
Breakup, incurable disease
You’re my beginning and my end, That is all
My meeting and my farewell
You were everything, step forward fear
It will be repeated, caused by you
Tear
Tear

10,epiphany,"

[Verse 1]
So weird, I for sure loved you so much
Adapted to you with everything, I wanted to live my life for you
But as I keep doing that I just can't bear the storm inside my heart
The real myself inside the smiling mask, I reveal it entirely

[Chorus]
I’m the one I should love in this world
Shining me, precious soul of mine
I finally realized so I love me
Not so perfect but so beautiful
I’m the one I should love

[Verse 2]
I’m shaking and afraid but I keep going forward
I’m meeting the real you, hidden in the storm
Why did I want to hide my precious self like this?
What was I so afraid of?
Why did I hide my true self?

[Chorus]
I’m the one I should love in this world
Shining me, precious soul of mine
I finally realized so I love me
Not so perfect but so beautiful
I'm the one I should love

[Bridge]
I may be a bit blunt, I may lack some things
I may not have that shy glow around me
But this is me
My arms, my legs, my heart, my soul

[Chorus]
I wanna love in this world
Shining me, precious soul of mine
I finally realized so I love me
Not so perfect but so beautiful
I'm the one I should love

I’m the one I should love
I’m the one I should love

[Verse 1: Jimin, Jungkook]
I’m opening my eyes in the darkness
When my heartbeat sounds unfamiliar
I’m looking at you in the mirror
The fear-ridden eyes, asking the question

[Verse 2: Suga]
Loving myself might be harder
Than loving someone else
Let’s admit it
The standards I made are more strict for myself
The thick tree rings in your life
It’s part of you, it’s you
Now let’s forgive ourselves
Our lives are long, trust yourself when in a maze
When winter passes, spring always comes

[Pre-Chorus: Jungkook, Jimin]
From the eyes of the cold night
I try to hide myself
As I keep tossing and turning ey
Maybe I fell in order to take the place of those countless stars
The target of  thousands of bright arrows is me alone

[Chorus: Jin, Jungkook]
You’ve shown me I have reasons
I should love myself (oh)
I’ll answer with my breath, my path

[Post-Chorus: V, Jungkook]
The me of yesterday, the me of today, the me of tomorrow
(I’m learning how to love myself)
With no exceptions, it’s all me

[Verse 3: RM]
Maybe there’s no answer
Maybe this isn’t the answer either
It’s just that loving myself
Doesn’t require anyone else’s permission
I’m looking for myself again
But I don’t wanna die anymore
Me, who used to be sad
Me, who used to be hurt
It’ll make me more beautiful

[Verse 4: J-hope]
Yes, I have that beauty
Knowing that is going
On the path to loving myself
It’s what I need the most
I’m walking for myself
It’s an action needed for me
My attitude towards myself
That’s the happiness I need for me
I’ll show you what I got
I’m not afraid because it’s me
Love myself

[Pre-Chorus: Jin, Jimin, Jungkook]
From the very beginning
To the very end
There’s only one answer ey
Why do you keep trying to hide under your mask? (hey)
Even all the scars from your mistakes make up your constellation (ey)

[Chorus: V, Jungkook]
You’ve shown me I have reasons
I should love myself (oh)
I’ll answer with my breath, my path

[Bridge: Jungkook, Jimin, V]
Inside of me
There’s still
That awkward part of me but (woah)

[Chorus: Jin, Jimin, Jungkook, V]
You’ve shown me I have reasons
I should love myself
(I’m learning how to love myself oh)
I’ll answer with my breath, my path

[Outro: V, Jimin, Jungkook]
The me of yesterday, the me of today, the me of tomorrow (woah)
(I’m learning how to love myself)
With no exceptions, it’s all me

13,magic-shop,"

[Verse 1: V, Jungkook]
I know that you’re hesitating because even if you say the truth
In the end it will all return as scars
I’m not going to say anything blatant like “find strength”
I will let you hear my story, let you hear it

[Verse 2: RM]
What did I say?
I said you’d win, didn’t I?
I couldn’t believe it (really)
Could I win it?
This miracle that isn’t a miracle
Did we make it?
(No) I was here
You were the one that made your way to me
I do believe your galaxy
I want to listen to your melody
Your stars in the Milky Way
Don’t forget that I found you anyways
At the end of my despair
You’re the last reason
For me who was standing at the edge of the cliff
Live

[Pre-Chorus: Jin, Jimin]
On days where I hate myself for being me, on days where I want to disappear forever
Let's make a door. It's in your heart
Open the door and this place will await
Magic Shop

[Chorus: Jungkook, Jimin]
While drinking a glass of hot tea
And looking up at the Milky Way
You’ll be alright, oh, this here is the Magic Shop

[Hook: Jungkook/Jimin/V/Jin, All]
So show me (I'll show you)
So show me (I'll show you)
So show me (I'll show you)
Show you show you

[Verse 3: J-Hope, Suga]
Like a rose when blooming
Like cherry blossoms when being scattered in the wind
Like morning glory when fading
Like that beautiful moment
I always want to be the best
So I was impatient and always restless
Comparing myself with others became my daily life
My greed that was my weapon suffocated me and also became a leash
But looking back on it now, truthfully
I feel like it’s not true that I wanted to be the best
I wanted to become your comfort and move your heart
I want to take away your sadness, and pain

[Pre-Chorus: Jungkook, Jin]
I want to disappear forever
Let's make a door. It's in your heart
Open the door and this place will wait
Magic Shop
Drink a cup of warm tea
Looking up at the Milky Way
You'll be fine oh

[Hook: Jungkook/Jimin/V/Jin, All]
So show me (I'll show you)
So show me (I'll show you)
So show me (I'll show you)
Show you show you

[Bridge: V, Jimin]
Would you believe me if I said that I was scared of everything too?
All the sincerity, the remaining times
All your answers are in this place you found
In your Milky Way, inside your heart

[Chorus: All]
You gave me the best of me
So you'll give you the best of you
You found me. You knew me
You gave me the best of me
So you'll give you the best of you
You'll find it, the galaxy inside you

[Hook: Jungkook/Jimin/V/Jin, All]
So show me (I'll show you)
So show me (I'll show you)
So show me (I'll show you)
Show you show you

14,best-of-me,"

[Intro: Jimin, Jungkook]
When you say that you love me
Feels like I’m walking across the sky
Tell me about forever, just one more time
When you say that you love me
I just need those words
That you’ll never change, just one more time

[Chorus: Jin, V]
You’re everything in this world to me
Harder, so it hurts, hold me tight
We shared something
And you can’t make it nothing
I hope you don’t forget
You’re my
Day by day
Summer, winter
Even if you don’t know

[Hook 1: Jungkook, J-Hope]
You got the best of me
You got the best of me
So please just don’t leave me
You got the best of me

[Verse 1: Rap Monster]
I haven’t seen the end to myself either
But if there’s such a thing, wouldn’t it be you?
I wanted to be a warm wave
But why didn’t I know you’re the ocean?
What do I do? I’m speaking in your language
I’m breathing in your breath
I’ll be you, you hold me
I’m kissing your sword

[Verse 2: Suga]
So take my hand right now
I can’t believe myself
Words I said thousands of times only to myself
Don’t leave me
You got the best of me
You got the best of me
Whether this is a dream or reality, it’s not important
Just the fact that you’re by my side
Thanks

[Chorus: V/Jin, Jin]
Day by day
Summer, winter
Even if you don’t know

[Hook 1: Jimin, Jungkook]
You got the best of me

[Hook 2: Jimin, Jungkook]
You’re my salvation, you’re my shield
I just need you
You got the best of me
I need you
So please just don’t leave me
You got the best of me

[Bridge 1: Jimin, Jungkook]
It was raining
It was snowing
But all unhappiness stopped
You brought heaven to me
Don’t speak so easily
Because without you, there’s no me
You’re the best of me
The best of me

[Bridge 2: J-Hope]
Just give me assurance
That’s all I want
Even if there are no rules
Laws of love do exist
Who got the best of me?
Who got the best of me?
No one knows but I know me
My greatest master is you

[Hook 1: All]
You got the best of me
You got the best of me
So please just don’t leave me
You got the best of me

[Hook 2: Jungkook, All]
You’re my salvation, you’re my shield
I just need you
You got the best of me
I need you
So please just don’t leave me
You got the best of me

[Outro: Jimin, Jungkook]
When you say that you love me
Feels like I’m walking across the sky
Tell me about forever, just one more time
When you say that you love me

I’m free (free)
No more irony (irony)

16,singularity,"

[Verse 1]
A sound of something breaking
I awake from sleep
A sound full of unfamiliarity
Try to cover my ears but can’t go to sleep

[Pre-Chorus]
The pain in my throat gets worse
Try to cover it
I don’t have a voice
Today I hear that sound again

[Chorus]
It’s ringing again, that sound
A crack again on this frozen lake
I dumped myself into the lake
I buried my voice for you
Over the winter lake I was thrown

[Verse 2]
A thick ice has formed
In the dream I shortly went into
My agonizing phantom pain is still the same
Have I lost myself

[Pre-Chorus]
Or have I gained you
I suddenly run to the lake
There’s my face in it
Please don’t say anything

[Chorus]
Reach my hand out to cover the mouth
But in the end, spring will come someday
The ice will melt and flow away
Tell me if my voice isn’t real

[Chorus]
If I shouldn’t have thrown myself away
Tell me if even this pain isn’t real
What I was supposed to do back then

17,fake-love,"

[Intro: V, Jungkook]
For you, I could pretend like I was happy when I was sad
For you, I could pretend like I was strong when I was hurt
I wish love was perfect as love itself
I wish all my weaknesses could be hidden
I grew a flower that can’t be bloomed in a dream that can’t come true

[Hook: Jimin, Jin]
I'm so sick of this fake love, fake love, fake love
I'm so sorry but it's fake love, fake love, fake love

[Verse 1: RM, RM & Jungkook, J-Hope]
I wanna be a good man, just for you
I gave the world, just for you
I changed everything, just for you
But I dunno me, Who are you?
The forest just for us, you weren’t there
The route I took, I forgot
I even became quite unsure of who I was
Try babbling into the mirror, who the heck are you?

[Pre-Chorus: Jimin, Jin]
For you, I could pretend like I was happy when I was sad
For you, I could pretend like I was strong when I was hurt
I wish love was perfect as love itself
I wish all my weaknesses could be hiddenI grew a flower that can’t be bloomed in a dream that can’t come true

[Chorus: Jungkook, V]
Love you so bad, love you so bad
Mold a pretty lie for you
Love it’s so mad, love it’s so mad
Try to erase myself and make me your doll
Love you so bad, love you so bad
Mold a pretty lie for you
Love it’s so mad, love it’s so mad
Try to erase myself and make me your doll

[Hook: Jimin, Jin]
I'm so sick of this fake love, fake love, fake love
I'm so sorry but it's fake love, fake love, fake love

[Verse 2: RM, Suga]
Why you sad? I don’t know. I don’t know
Smile, say 'I love you'
Look at me, even I gave up on myself
Even you can’t understand me
You say I’m unfamiliar, changed into the one you used to like
You say I’m not myself which you knew well
No? What do you mean no? I’m blind
Love? What the heck is love? It’s all fake love

[Bridge: Jimin, Jin]
Woo, I dunno, I dunno, I dunno why
Woo, even I, even I don’t know myself
Woo, I just know, I just know, I just know why
Cuz it’s all fake love, fake love, fake love

[Chorus: Jungkook, Jimin]
Love you so bad, love you so bad
Mold a pretty lie for you
Love it’s so mad, love it’s so mad
Try to erase myself and make me your doll
Love you so bad, love you so bad
Mold a pretty lie for you
Love it’s so mad, love it’s so mad
Try to erase myself and make me your doll

[Hook: Jimin, Jin]
I'm so sick of this fake love, fake love, fake love
I'm so sorry but it's fake love, fake love, fake love

For you, I could pretend like I was happy when I was sad
For you, I could pretend like I was strong when I was hurt
I wish love was perfect as love itself
I wish all my weaknesses could be hidden
I grew a flower that can’t be bloomed in a dream that can’t come true

"
18,the-truth-untold,"

[Verse 1: V]
Full of loneliness
This garden bloomed
Full of thorns
I bind myself in this sand castle

[Verse 2: Jungkook]
What is your name
Do you have a place to go
Oh could you tell me?
I saw you hiding in this garden

[Pre-Chorus: Jin]
And I know
All of your warmth is real
The blue flower your hand was picking
I want to hold it but

[Chorus: Jimin]
It’s my fate
Don’t smile to me
Lie to me
Because I can’t get closer to you
There’s no name you can call me

[Post-Chorus: Jungkook]
You know that I can’t
Show you me
Give you me
I can’t show you a ruined part of myself
Once again I put a mask again and go to see you
But I still want you

[Verse 3: Jin]
Bloomed in a garden of loneliness
A flower that resembles you
I wanted to give it to you
After I take off this foolish mask

[Pre-Chorus: Jimin]
But I know
I can't do that forever
I have to hide
Because I'm a monster

[Chorus: V]
I am afraid
I am shattered
I’m so afraid
That you will leave me again in the end
Once again I put on a mask and go to see you

[Post-Chorus: Jungkook]
The only thing I can do
In the garden
In this world
Is to bloom a pretty flower that resembles you
And to breathe as the me that you know
But I still want you
I still want you

[Chorus: Jin]
Maybe back then
A little
Just this much
If I had the courage to stand before you
Would everything be different now

[Bridge: Jimin, Jungkook]
I'm crying
That’s disappeared
That’s fallen
Left alone in this sandcastle
Looking at this broken mask

[Outro: Jimin, Jungkook]
And I still want you
But I still want you
But I still want you
And I still want you

"
19,134340,"

[Verse 1: V, Jungkook]
If only I could, I wanted to ask you
Why did you do that back then? Why did you kick me out?
Without a name to myself, I still revolve around you
Our goodbye is colorless, that unchanging color

[Verse 2: RM]
There’s no name allowed for me
I, too, used to be your star
You must feel nice to be the light
All I did was to receive you

What meaning is left of the fallen planet’s remaining life
I’ll receive it til I die, your stifling stare
I still orbit you, and nothing’s changed
If love has no name, everything has changed

Could it be really that you’ve found Eris
Tell me, how am I not as good as that moon
Us is the plural form of U
Maybe I wasn’t there from the start

Someday, you’ll also understand my words
My seasons were always you
My cold heart is 248 degrees below zero
It stopped the day you erased me
Damn

[Pre-Chorus: Jimin, Jin]
I’m just orbiting you
(I missed you, I lost you)
I’m just going in circles
(You erased me, you forgot me)

[Chorus: Jungkook, V]
I once belonged in a world under the sun
(The song paused, the song stopped)
A smoky layer of mist in the heart of the stars
(You erased me, you forgot me)

[Verse 3: Suga]
It’s not much different from yesterday ay
Same old days, except you’re not here
We were together just up until yesterday ay
But it’s to the point where it’s scary, same days but no you

I’ll be honest, even up until one year without you
I was fine, I didn’t have any feelings left
The last day I had forgotten
I don’t even remember your scent

But wait, I’ve smelled this perfume somewhere, ay
Just when my memory was about to come back
I turned my head around and saw you
You’re smiling brightly, but beside you there’s

Ah (Hello?) Hello
How are you? I’m doing okay
Unlike my heart, that feels like it’ll explode
The temperature right now is -248 degrees

[Pre-Chorus: Jin, Jungkook]
I’m just orbiting you
(I missed you, I lost you)
I’m just going in circles
(You erased me, you forgot me)

[Chorus: Jungkook, Jimin]
I once belonged in a world under the sun
(The song paused, the song stopped)
A smoky layer of mist in the heart of the stars
(You erased me, you forgot me)

[Bridge: Jin, J-Hope]
I’m just orbiting you
(Beyond the fog, I watch you as you continue to smile
Without you or anything
There’s no meaning to my irregular orbit)

I’m just going in circles
(I’m just a hard number to remember
And the Pluto of darkness
But I’ll continue to orbit around you forever, damn)

[Pre-Chorus: V, Jungkook]
I’m just orbiting you
(I missed you, I lost you)
I’m just going in circles
(You erased me, you forgot me)

[Chorus: Jungkook, Jimin]
I once belonged in a world under the sun
(The song paused, the song stopped)
A smoky layer of mist in the heart of the stars
(You erased me, you forgot me)

20,paradise,"

[Verse 1: Jungkook]
Marathon marathon
Life’s long so take it slow
42.195
The end is filled with a paradise of dreams

[Pre-Chorus: Jimin, Jimin & Jungkook]
But the real world is
Different from what’s promised
We need to run, we need to step on it
If you shoot a flare
You don’t have a destination
There’s no sceneries at all
Until your breath comes up to your chin
You need to you need to

[Chorus: V, Jungkook, Jin, Jimin]
It’s alright to stop
There’s no need to run without even knowing the reason
It’s alright to not have a dream
If you have moments where you feel happiness for a while
It’s alright to stop
Now we don’t run without knowing the destination
It’s alright to not have a dream
All the breaths you breathe are already in paradise

[Verse 2: RM]
We borrow dreams from others (Like a debt)
We learn that we need to become great (Like a light)
Your dream. Is actually a burden
If having a future is a dream
Then what is the dream you had last night in your bed?
It’s alright if the name of the dream is different
Be it buying a laptop next month
Or just eating and sleeping
Not doing anything at all and still having a lot of money
Who says a dream must be something grand
Just become anybody
We deserve a life
Whatever big or small, you are you after all

[Pre-Chorus: Jimin, Jimin & Jungkook]
But the real world is
Different from what’s promised
We need to run, we need to step on it
If you shoot a flare
You don’t have a destination
There’s no sceneries at all
Until your breath comes up to your chin
You need to you need to

[Chorus: V, Jungkook, Jin, Jimin]
It’s alright to stop
There’s no need to run without even knowing the reason
It’s alright to not have a dream
If you have moments where you feel happiness for a while
It’s alright to stop
Now we don’t run without knowing the destination
It’s alright to not have a dream
All the breaths you breathe are already in paradise

[Verse 3: Suga]
I don’t have a dream
To have a dream, is sometimes scary
To just live like this
To survive like this is a small dream to me
To have a dream, to grasp a dream
To breathe, is sometimes too much to handle
Saying this person’s living like this, that person’s living like that
The world’s swearing at me

[Verse 4: J-Hope]
Yeah
The world doesn’t have the right to swear
What is the way to dream a dream
Since they never taught us that
In the made up dream, sleep-talk of tears
Waking up from a nightmare, for you
Now let’s try to smile everyday, in that paradise

[Chorus: V, Jimin]
It’s alright to stop
Now we don’t run without even knowing the destination
It’s alright to not have a dream
All the breaths you breathe are already in paradise

[Bridge: All]
Stop runnin’ for nothin’ my friend
Now stop that foolish race
Stop runnin’ for nothin’ my friend
All the breaths you breathe are already in paradise
Stop runnin’ for nothin’ my friend
You don’t need something like a dream that everyone dreams
Stop runnin’ for nothin’ my friend
Every language that makes you, is already in paradise

Cuz I’ll be in love maze
Cuz I’ll be in love maze

[Verse 1: Jimin]
Trapped in a maze of decisions
Exhausted by all the different chaos
We’ve wandered around, looking for the answer
Lost in the maze, in the darkness

[Verse 2: Jungkook]
We ran and ran endlessly
But all the fake noise
Can’t tear us apart
It’s true baby

[Refrain: Jimin, Jin]
We must believe only in ourselves
Can’t let go of each other’s hands
We need to be together forever

[Verse 3: RM]
People say
That I’ll end up a fool
But I don’t wanna use my head
I don’t wanna calculate
Love ain’t a business
Rather like a fitness
I’ve never been in a calculating love
I know it’ll be cold like winter
But I still wanna try
If you push me, I’ll fall, just raise me up again
Even if I pull, you don’t have to come
Let them be them
Let us be us
Love is a maze damn
But you is amaze yeah

[Chorus: Jimin, V]
Take my ay ay hand, don’t let go
Lie ay ay in this maze
My ay ay never lose me
In love maze
Take my ay ay hand, don’t let go
My ay ay come closer
My ay ay never go away

No matter what others say, don’t listen
Just let’em talk, whatever they say
The more they do, the more I’m sure
Yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah

Can’t you hear me, you have to trust me
Baby just don’t give a damn
Promise, promise me

[Verse 4: Suga]
All around us is a maze, different paths
We’re walking in this abyss
There’s a thin light over there
I hope we’re going toward paradise
Know this, sometimes lies will try to tear us apart
Hardships will try to deceive us but
Just focus on me then
In the darkness, just the two of us is enough
In all these lies
If we’re together, even an endless maze is paradise

[Chorus: Jin]
Take my ay ay hand, don’t let go
Lie ay ay in this maze
My ay ay never lose me
In love maze

[Verse 5: J-Hope]
What can we do? We did the official thing
So we need to follow the rules
Even in this wandering maze
Even on this mysterious path
We’re taking care of each other
I always think, even if eternity is hard
I wanna try it, let’s be forever
Our own mountain, our own climb
Our own world, our own heart
Travel toward the exit
Our held hands will be the map

[Chorus: Jungkook, V]
Take my ay ay hand, don’t let go
Lie ay ay in this maze
My ay ay never lose me
In love maze
Take my ay ay hand, don’t let go
My ay ay come closer
My ay ay never go away
In love maze

While drinking a glass of hot tea
And looking up at the Milky Way
You’ll be alright, oh, this here is the Magic Shop

[Hook: Jungkook/Jimin/V/Jin, All]
So show me (I'll show you)
So show me (I'll show you)
So show me (I'll show you)
Show you show you

[Verse 3: J-Hope, Suga]
Like a rose when blooming
Like cherry blossoms when being scattered in the wind
Like morning glory when fading
Like that beautiful moment
I always want to be the best
So I was impatient and always restless
Comparing myself with others became my daily life
My greed that was my weapon suffocated me and also became a leash
But looking back on it now, truthfully
I feel like it’s not true that I wanted to be the best
I wanted to become your comfort and move your heart
I want to take away your sadness, and pain

[Pre-Chorus: Jungkook, Jin]
I want to disappear forever
Let's make a door. It's in your heart
Open the door and this place will wait
Magic Shop
Drink a cup of warm tea
Looking up at the Milky Way
You'll be fine oh

[Hook: Jungkook/Jimin/V/Jin, All]
So show me (I'll show you)
So show me (I'll show you)
So show me (I'll show you)
Show you show you

[Bridge: V, Jimin]
Would you believe me if I said that I was scared of everything too?
All the sincerity, the remaining times
All your answers are in this place you found
In your Milky Way, inside your heart

[Chorus: All]
You gave me the best of me
So you'll give you the best of you
You found me. You knew me
You gave me the best of me
So you'll give you the best of you
You'll find it, the galaxy inside you

[Hook: Jungkook/Jimin/V/Jin, All]
So show me (I'll show you)
So show me (I'll show you)
So show me (I'll show you)
Show you show you

23,so-what,"

Somebody call me right one
Somebody call me wrong
I’m not gonna care about it
Why don’t you not do so as well
So what
Let go

In a sigh, lots of worries are hiding
Stop thinking about it, You already know it all
In the middle of the road, in the moment you want to give up
Shout out louder
So what, what, what
There’s nothing that works out as I wanted
There’s even fewer places for me to hide
It’s already been a while since the dice were rolled
If you dawdle, you’ll be swept away, oh bae
90% of your worries are an imaginary swamp that you created
Just go instead of worrying, Don’t get scared, cheer up
Shout it out, So what, what

We are, we are, we are
Young & wild & free
Your worries, worries, without no answer
Don’t fall into them and stay in them

Even if you’re in danger on the boundary
Let’s cut through the wind while laughing and chatting
Sometimes run like a fool
With mistakes and in tears, we just go

So what
Don’t stop and worry yourself
It’s good for nothing
Let go
Although there’s no answer yet
You can start the fight

So what
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Let go
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
So what

Ay some say they hate their work
Ay some say they only want to rest
Ay their pain and devastation
Ay when all those rage at me
Ay what else can I do, uh
Since there’s only one answer, uh
Let’s just trust it and run
So what?

I don’t wanna die right now
I don’t wanna, I don’t wanna fight right now
I don’t like worries, Life is long
Just go, I wanna live right now
Since the brake is broken, step on the accelerator
However you do
Where’s the fun if you know all about a person’s life
Pain is my medal
So, so what?

We are, we are, we are
Young & wild & free
Your worries, worries without no answer
Don’t fall into them and stay in them

Even if you’re in danger on the boundary
Let’s cut through the wind while laughing and chatting

"
24,tear,"

[Verse 1: RM]
Goodbyes are, for me, a tear
Without even knowing, it blooms around my eyes
The words that I could not bring myself to say flow down
And lingering regret crawls over my face
To me, you were once my dear
But now you’re merely a bitter beer
My heart that’s stained with belated self-loathing
Becomes empty even with the passing breeze
At the end of my play where breakup was a lie
The price that I had to pay came to me
If someone said they would turn back the time for me
Would I have been able to be a bit more honest?
The bare face that only I know
The ugly and pathetic old friends within me
Would you still be able to love me again like before
With that smile with which you used look at me
Stop saying things like forever, forever
After all, the end originally exists
If there’s a start, I don’t wanna listen to that
Words that are too correct or too much consolation.. I don’t wanna listen to that
I was just so scared
Because it seemed like perhaps I had never loved you at all
Although it was late, that you were true
That only you loved me
More

[Chorus: RM]
You’re my tear
You’re my you’re my tear
You’re my tear
You’re my you’re my tear
You’re my tear
You’re my you’re my tear
What more can I say?
You’re my tear

[Verse 2: J-Hope, Suga]
We walked towards the same place
But this place becomes our last
Although we used to talk about forever
Now we break each other without mercy
Although we thought that we dreamed the same dream
That dream has finally become a dream
My heart is torn, please burn it instead
So that pain and regret, none of that would be left

[Chorus: RM, Suga, J-Hope]
You’re my tear
You’re my, you’re my tear
You’re my tear
You’re my, you’re my tear
You’re my fear
You’re my, you’re my fear
What more can I say?
You’re my...

[Verse 3: Suga]
Goodbyes are T.E.A.R
Because things like tears are a luxury
There’s no such thing as beautiful goodbyes
So just begin now
Woo take it easy slowly carve out my heart
That’s right, that’s right, gently step on the shards that have shattered
So that regret, regret, such a thing will no longer be left
Please burn up my heart that was torn into shreds
That’s right, right there, what are you hesitating for
This is the ending you were wishing for
So go on and kill me without hesitating
Woo yeah yeah burn it
Woo yeah yeah yeah burn it
Woo yeah yeah yeah burn it
So not even the ashes remain

[Verse 4: Suga]
This is the real you and this is the real me
Now we’ve seen the end and not even resentment is left
I’ve woken up from the sweet dream and I close my eyes
This is the real you and this is the real me

[Verse 5: RM, Suga]
We walked towards the same place
But this place becomes our last
Although we used to talk about forever
Now we break each other without mercy
Although we thought that we dreamed the same dream
That dream has finally become a dream
My heart is torn, please burn it instead
So that pain and regret, none of that would be left

[Chorus: RM, Suga, J-Hope]
You’re my tear
You’re my, you’re my tear
You’re my tear
You’re my, you’re my tear
You’re my fear
You’re my, you’re my fear
What more can I say?
You’re my...

[Bridge: Suga]
What should I say
We know
The answer is fixed
But replying is always hard

[Verse 6: J-Hope]
Why are you spilling it
Why are you tearing it up
It’s useless, to me
Goodbye to me is only those moments (Flashback)
The moment you say words from your mouth
The moment our focus becomes irregular
At the moment where everything is dangerous
Our end that two letters handed to us
That I won’t cry, that I won’t tear it up
I can’t say those kinds of words. In the future I, too
Breakup, incurable disease
You’re my beginning and my end, That is all
My meeting and my farewell
You were everything, step forward fear
It will be repeated, caused by you
Tear
Tear

25,best-of-me,"

[Intro: Jimin, Jungkook]
When you say that you love me
Feels like I’m walking across the sky
Tell me about forever, just one more time
When you say that you love me
I just need those words
That you’ll never change, just one more time

[Chorus: Jin, V]
You’re everything in this world to me
Harder, so it hurts, hold me tight
We shared something
And you can’t make it nothing
I hope you don’t forget
You’re my
Day by day
Summer, winter
Even if you don’t know

[Hook 1: Jungkook, J-Hope]
You got the best of me
You got the best of me
So please just don’t leave me
You got the best of me

[Verse 1: Rap Monster]
I haven’t seen the end to myself either
But if there’s such a thing, wouldn’t it be you?
I wanted to be a warm wave
But why didn’t I know you’re the ocean?
What do I do? I’m speaking in your language
I’m breathing in your breath
I’ll be you, you hold me
I’m kissing your sword

[Verse 2: Suga]
So take my hand right now
I can’t believe myself
Words I said thousands of times only to myself
Don’t leave me
You got the best of me
You got the best of me
Whether this is a dream or reality, it’s not important
Just the fact that you’re by my side
Thanks

[Chorus: V/Jin, Jin]
Day by day
Summer, winter
Even if you don’t know

[Hook 1: Jimin, Jungkook]
You got the best of me

[Hook 2: Jimin, Jungkook]
You’re my salvation, you’re my shield
I just need you
You got the best of me
I need you
So please just don’t leave me
You got the best of me

[Bridge 1: Jimin, Jungkook]
It was raining
It was snowing
But all unhappiness stopped
You brought heaven to me
Don’t speak so easily
Because without you, there’s no me
You’re the best of me
The best of me

[Bridge 2: J-Hope]
Just give me assurance
That’s all I want
Even if there are no rules
Laws of love do exist
Who got the best of me?
Who got the best of me?
No one knows but I know me
My greatest master is you

[Hook 1: All]
You got the best of me
You got the best of me
So please just don’t leave me
You got the best of me

[Hook 2: Jungkook, All]
You’re my salvation, you’re my shield
I just need you
You got the best of me
I need you
So please just don’t leave me

[Outro: Jimin, Jungkook]
When you say that you love me
Feels like I’m walking across the sky
Tell me about forever, just one more time
When you say that you love me
I just need those words
That you’ll never change, just one more time

All the underdogs in the world
A day may come when we lose
But it is not today

If you can’t fly, then run

27,crystal-snow,"

[Verse 1: Jungkook]
Like snow piles up, I remember what you gave me
You gave me the courage to live

[Verse 2: J-hope]
We met each other beyond all time
So now how do we do? Can we make it work?
This fragile love

[Verse 3: V]
The world moves faster than we thought
How we gonna change it?
We don’t know yet but for sure we will

[Pre-Chorus: Jimin and V]
(Eh) Love in our hearts, uh yeah
(Eh) slowly started to grow

[Chorus: Jimin, Jin , Jungkook , V]
I want to hold you one more time before you disappear
Ah, crystal flies high wherever it goes
Hey, there’s nothing else I want, I just want to feel a little more
Can I touch your heart？
I want to touch it but it keeps slipping through my fingers, someday, someday

[Verse 4: V and Jungkook]
Your little smile somehow hurts me
How can I be closer uh uh?
Why can’t I find an answer for this love?
How am I gonna find it? How?
Oh, let me know

[Verse 5: Suga]
Crystal snow only holds an ambiguous shape
I can't bear my story of unrequited love
Eh I’ll manage to change it on my own

[Pre-Chorus #2: Jin]
(Eh) surely, I can promise you

[Chorus: Jimin, Jin , Jungkook , V]
I want to protect you one more time before tears run down your face
But crystal gets further from reach, the more I wish for it
Even after hundred years, I want to live with you
Can I be your one?
There is no single star in this snowy sky, oh, someday, someday

[Bridge: RM and Jungkook]
The two of us are already far apart
Even though we are meant to be together
Now we can't choose the paint that colors us
Even the black breath
Even your thick white fog
I feel, I feel, I feel, I feel
Oh yeah, oh, crystal snow, crystal snow
Inside the white fog
Even though you pass through me and turn to water, you are still in my heart
(You are in my heart)
I watch you shining and reflecting on every single sparkling thing
I’ll wait for you no matter where
I want to see you, even if you're pretending, please hold this hand

[Pre-Chorus #3: V and Jin]
The warmth of love started melting
This genuine warmth, please stay forever

[Chorus: Jimin, Jin , Jungkook , V]
I want to hold you one more time before you disappear
Crystal flies high to reach you
Hey, words aren't enough to express my feelings but I will tell you as it is
Can I touch your heart?
I want you to believe me, I’ll come get you
Someday, someday

[Outro: Jungkook, V, Jimin, Jin]
It’s always you, it’s always you, crystal snow
(Let me see your smile, oh baby, eh)
It’s always you, it’s always you, crystal snow
(Let me feel your love forever, hoo)
It’s always you, it’s always you, crystal snow
(Let me feel your love, our crystal snow yeah)
It’s always you, it’s always you, crystal snow
Oh yeah, crystal snow, oh, oh
Forever baby (baby), crystal snow

28,spring-day,"

[Verse 1: RM, J-Hope]
Miss you
Saying this makes me miss you even more
Miss you
Even though I’m looking at your photo
Time’s so cruel, I hate us
Seeing each other for once is now so hard between us

[Verse 2: RM]
It’s all winter here, even in August
My heart is running on the time
Alone on the Snowpiercer
Wanna get to the other side of the earth, holding your hand
Wanna put an end to this winter
How much longing should we see snowing down
To have the days of spring, Friend

[Verse 3: Jimin, V]
Like the tiny dust, tiny dust floating in the air
Will I get to you a little faster
If I was the snow in the air

[Pre-Chorus 1: Jungkook, V]
Snowflakes fall down
And get farther away little by little
I miss you (I miss you)
I miss you (I miss you)
How long do I have to wait
And how many sleepless nights do I have to spend
To see you (to see you)
To meet you (to meet you)

[Chorus: Jungkook, Jin, J-Hope]
Passing by the edge of the cold winter
Until the days of spring
Until the days of flower blossoms
Please stay, please stay there a little longer

[Verse 4: Suga, Jimin]
Is it you who changed (Is it you who changed)
Or is it me (Or is it me)
I hate this moment, this time flowing by
We are changed you know
Just like everyone you know

[Verse 5: Suga, Jimin]
Yes I hate you, you left me
But I never stopped thinking about you, not even a day
Honestly I miss you, but I’ll erase you
'Cause it hurts less than to blame you

[Verse 6: Jin, Jimin]
I try to exhale you in pain
Like smoke, like white smoke
I say that I’ll erase you
But I can’t really let you go yet

[Pre-Chorus 1: Jungkook, V]
Snowflakes fall down
And get farther away little by little
I miss you (I miss you)
I miss you (I miss you)
How long do I have to wait
And how many sleepless nights do I have to spend
To see you (to see you)
To meet you (to meet you)

[Bridge: V, Jungkook]
You know it all
You’re my best friend
The morning will come again
No darkness, no season is eternal

[Pre-Chorus 2: Jimin, Jungkook, V]
Maybe it’s cherry blossoms
And this winter will be over
I miss you (I miss you)
I miss you (I miss you)
Wait a little bit, just a few more nights
I’ll be there to see you (I'll go there to meet you)
I’ll come for you (I'll come for you)

[Chorus: Jungkook, J-Hope, Jin ]
Passing by the edge of the cold winter
Until the days of spring
Until the days of flower blossoms
Please stay, please stay there a little longer

"
29,let-go,"

Before we say goodbye, let go
But I’m lost in the maze of my heart
From stereo to mono
That’s how the path splits

If my fate is to disappear like this, then this is my last letter
Penned words, written then erased
Feelings for you, so many to let go
Unpuzzle my lego
At a level where it can’t return to its original shape
So be it don’t cry
I’mma let you go and fly

Hectic days, keeping myself busy
Distraction filled schedule
But I won’t forget
Burned into the back of my mind like tattoo
We can’t return to those days
If I could, I’d call your name
No… but I’ll accept your blame
It really is time to say goodbye

Before we say goodbye, let go
But I’m lost in the maze of my heart
From stereo to mono
That’s how the path splits
It continues

In order to release your hand right now
I gotta let you know that I need to let you go
Hard to say goodbye
But I can’t run
I’m ready to let go
I’m ready to let go
I’m ready to let go

What have you been up to lately?
Who are you thinking of so far away?
Life without you is really unbelievable
But even so I still gotta go
To the person I loved too much
To the red thread that got too entangled in itself
I couldn't reach you, so I'll walk a separate path
For that reason I’ll say goodbye

At first every day is like that
Beyond the tears hidden in the rain
I’ll wait for you, let’s start over
So that in the future
I can meet you again with a smile

In order to release your hand right now
I gotta let you know that I need to let you go
Hard to say goodbye
But I can’t run
I’m ready to let go
I’m ready to let go
I’m ready to let go

The color of the sky we saw together
The scent of the path we walked down together
Don’t forget them

In order to release your hand right now
I gotta let you know that I need to let you go
Hard to say goodbye
But I can’t run
I’m ready to let go
I’m ready to let go
I’m ready to let go

"
30,run,"

[Verse 1: Rap Monster]
You’re my sun, one and only in this world
I bloom for you, but you make me thirsty
It’s too late, too late
I can’t live without you
Even if I‘m drying out, I try harder to reach you

[Verse 1: Suga]
But it’s no use, it’s a dream to be broken
I run and run, but I’m not getting anywhere
Just burn me out, yes
Keep pushing me away
This is a fool, crazy in love, chasing in circles

[Pre-Chorus: V]
Make me run
Make me run more
Let my feet rip apart with wounds
At least I can I smile when I see you

[Chorus]
I run, run, run
I can’t stop
Run, run, run again
I can’t help it
This is all I can do anyway
All I know is how to love you

Run, run, run again
It’s okay to fall
Run, run. Run, again
It’s okay to get hurt
I’m alright, even if I can’t have you
Pitiful destiny, point your finger at me

(Run)
Don’t tell me bye bye
(Run)
You make me cry cry
(Run)
Love is a lie lie
Don’t tell me, don’t tell me
Don’t tell me bye bye

[Verse 3: J-Hope]
Everyone says it’s over, but I can’t stop
Is this sweat or tear, I can’t really tell oh
My love stripped bare, the stormy winds
They make me run again, my heart beats again

[Pre-Chorus: Jin]
Make me run
Make me run more
Let my feet rip apart with wounds
At least I can I smile when I see you

[Chorus]
I run, run, run
I can’t stop
Run, run, run again
I can’t help it
This is all I can do anyway
All I know is how to love you

Run, run, run again
It’s okay to fall
Run, run. Run, again
It’s okay to get hurt
I’m alright, even if I can’t have you
Pitiful destiny, point your finger at me

[Bridge: V, Jungkook, Jin]
Memories crumble like dried flower petals
At the tip of my fingers, under my feet
Right behind your back
I’m chasing butterflies, so lost in dreams
I follow your traces
Show me the way, please stop me
Let me breathe

[Chorus]
I run, run, run
I can’t stop
Run, run, run again
I can’t help it
This is all I can do anyway
All I know is how to love you

Run, run, run again
It’s okay to fall
Run, run. Run, again
It’s okay to get hurt
I’m alright, even if I can’t have you
Pitiful destiny, point your finger at me

(Run)
Don’t tell me bye bye
(Run)
You make me cry cry
(Run)
Love is a lie lie
Don’t tell me, don’t tell me
Don’t tell me bye bye

When I wake up in my room, I have nothing
After the sun sets, I sway as I walk
I’m completely drunk, drunk
I’m swearing on the streets
I’ve lost it, I’m like a crazy guy
Everything’s a mess, livin’ like beep

Live however you want, it’s yours anyway

Hey, burn it up
Like you’re gonna set everything on fire
Hey, turn it up
Until the dawn is gone
It's ok to just live because we're still young
Who do you think you are to say otherwise
Stop comparing, I'm just human
(So what~)

Live however you want, it’s yours anyway
Stop trying, it’s okay to lose

We're drenched, drenched, drenched
In sweat, in our practice room
Look, my great, great, great
Dance moves prove it all
All the weak, loser, whiny idiots
They have nothing on me
Cuz i'm full of hope haha

[Verse 2: Suga]
Ok we're dope from head to toe
Over half of the day, we drown in work
Even if our youth rots in the studio
Thanks to that, we're closer to success
Girls, shout louder
Make it ring, ring

[Pre-Chorus 1: V]
I worked all night, every day
While you were playing in the club
Differently from other guys
I don’t wanna say yes
I don’t wanna say yes

[Pre-Chorus 2: Jin/Jimin, Jungkook]
Make some noise, all right
Till your body burns up, all night (all night)
Cause we got fire (fire!)
Higher (higher!)
I gotta make it, I gotta make it
It’s sick

[Chorus: All]
I reject rejection
I'm always over the top
Everyone copies me
Dope, dope, dope, dope
I Reject rejection
You all work for me
Everyone copies me
Dope, dope, dope

[Verse 6: Rap Monster, Suga]
Given up on 3? Given up on 5??
I like the number 6, how about giving up on 6?
The media and adults say we don’t have willpower, condemning us like stocks
Why are they killing us before we can even try, enemy enemy enemy
Why are you hanging your head and accepting it already? energy energy energy
Don’t ever give up, you know you not lonely
Our dawn is prettier than the day
So can I get a little bit of hope yeah
Wake your sleeping youth, go

[Verse 7: V]
I worked all night, every day
While you were playing in the club
Differently from other guys
I don’t wanna say yes

Make some noise, all right
Till your body burns up, all night, all night
Cause we got fire fire
Higher higher
I gotta make it, I gotta make it
It’s sick

[Chorus]
I reject rejection
I was always too much
Everyone follow me
It’s sick

Reject rejection
You're all my slaves
Everyone follow me
It’s sick

[Bridge: Jimin, Jungkook]
This kind of thing is BTS Style
Different from those lying wack jobs
Every day is hustle life
I gotta make it fire baby

This kind of thing is BTS style
Different from those lying wack jobs
Every day is hustle life
I gotta make it
I gotta make it
I’m kinda awesome

[Chorus]
Say what! (god dammit)
Say wo~ wo~
Say what!
Dope

33,save-me,"

I want to breathe, I hate this night
I want to wake up, I hate this dream
I’m trapped inside of myself and I’m dead
Don’t wanna be lonely
Just wanna be yours

Why is it so dark where you’re not here
It’s dangerous how wrecked I am
Save me because I can’t get a grip on myself

Listen to my heartbeat
It calls you whenever it wants to
Because within this pitch black darkness
You are shining so brightly

Give me your hand
Save me save me
I need your love before
I fall, fall
Give me your hand save me save me
I need your love before I fall, fall

Give me your hand save me save me
Give me your hand save me save me

Save me, save me

Today the moon shines brighter on the blank spot in my memories
It swallowed me, this lunatic, please save me tonight
(Please save me tonight, please save me tonight)
Within this childish madness you will save me tonight

I knew that your salvation
Is a part of my life and the only helping hand that will embrace my pain
The best of me, you’re the only thing I have
Please raise your voice so that I can laugh again
Play on

Listen to my heartbeat, it calls you whenever it wants to
Because within this pitch black darkness, you are shining so brightly

Give me your hand save me save me
I need your love before I fall, fall
Give me your hand save me save me
I need your love before I fall, fall

Give me your hand save me save me
Give me your hand save me save me

Thank you for letting me be me
For helping me fly
For giving me wings
For straightening me out
For waking me from being suffocated
For waking me from a dream which was all I was living in
When I think of you the sun comes out
So I gave my sadness to the dog
(Thank you. For being ‘us’)

Give me your hand save me save me
I need your love before I fall, fall
Give me your hand save me save me
I need your love before I fall, fall

[Verse 1: Jungkook]
Don’t think of anything
Don’t say anything, not even a word
Just give me a smile

[V]
I still can’t believe it
All of this seems like a dream
Don’t try to disappear

[Pre-Chorus: Jungkook]
Is it true Is it true
You You
You’re so beautiful, that I’m scared

[Jimin]
Untrue Untrue
You You You

[Refrain: Jungkook]
Will you stay by my side
Will you promise me
If I let go of your hand, you’ll fly away and break
I’m scared scared scared of that

[Jimin]
Will you stop time
If this moment passes
As though it hadn’t happened
I’m scared scared scared I’ll lose you

[Chorus: Jungkook]
Butterfly like a Butterfly
Just like a Butterfly bu butterfly

[V]
Butterfly like a butterfly
Just like a Butterfly bu butterfly

[Verse 2: Suga]
You’re just like a Butterfly
From afar, I steal glances; if we touch hands, will I lose you?
You shine in this pitch darkness that is the butterfly effect
Your light touches, I forget the reality at once

[Verse 3: J-Hope]
It’s like a wind that gently strokes me
It’s like a dust that gently drifts along
You’re there but for some reason, I can’t reach you, stop
You, who’s like a dream is a butterfly high to me

[Pre-Chorus: Jin]
Untrue Untrue
You You You

[Refrain: Jungkook]
Will you stay by my side
Will you promise me
If I let go of your hand, you’ll fly away and break
I’m scared scared scared of that

[V]
Will you stop time
If this moment passes
As though it hadn’t happened
I’m scared scared scared I’ll lose you

[Bridge: Rap Monster]
The small pieces guttered down darkly
From my heart, a barren noise
I don’t know if this is reality or a dream
My Kafka on the seaside
Don’t go to those woods over there
My heart is still shattering on you
(I just wanted to vaporize like this)
My love that is forever
It’s all FREE for you baby

[Refrain: Jungkook]
Will you stay by my side
Will you promise me
If I let go of your hand, you’ll fly away and break
I’m scared scared scared of that

[V]
Will you stop time
If this moment passes
As though it hadn’t happened
I’m scared scared scared I’ll lose you

Butterfly like a Butterfly
Just like a Butterfly bu butterfly

Butterfly like a butterfly
Just like a Butterfly bu butterfly

Fall Fall Fall, scattering apart
Fall Fall Fall, falling

[Verse 1: Suga]
Because of you, I’m becoming ruined
I wanna stop, I don’t want you anymore
I can’t do it, this sucks
Please don’t give me any excuses

[Verse 2: J-Hope]
You can’t do this to me
All of the things you said are like a mask
It hides the truth and rips me apart
It pierces me, I’m going crazy, I hate this
Take it all away, I hate you

[Verse 3: V, RM, Suga]
But you’re my everything (You’re my)
Everything (You’re my)
Everything (You’re my)
Please go away huh

I’m sorry (I hate you)
I love you (I hate you)
Forgive me

[Chorus: Jimin, Jungkook, RM, Jungkook & RM]
I need you girl
Why am I in love alone, why am I hurting alone
I need you girl
Why do I keep needing you when I know I’ll get hurt?

I need you girl, you’re beautiful
I need you girl, you’re so cold
I need you girl I need you girl
I need you girl I need you girl

[Verse 4: RM, V]
It goes round & round, why do I keep coming back
I go down & down, at this point, I’m just a fool
Whatever I do, I can’t help it
It’s definitely my heart, my feelings but why don’t they listen to me
I’m just talking to myself again, talking to myself again
I’m just talking to myself again, talking to myself again
You’re not saying anything, please, I’ll treat you well
But the sky is blue, the sky is blue

[Verse 5: Jin]
The sky is blue and the sun is shining
So my tears are even more noticeable
Why is it you? Why did it have to be you?
Why can’t I leave you?

[Chorus: Jungkook, Jimin, RM, Jungkook & RM]
I need you girl
Why am I in love alone, why am I hurting alone
I need you girl
Why do I keep needing you when I know I’ll get hurt?

I need you girl, you’re beautiful
I need you girl, you’re so cold
I need you girl I need you girl
I need you girl I need you girl

[Bridge: Jin, V, Jungkook, Jimin]
Girl, just tell me you wanna break up
Girl, just tell me it wasn’t love
I have no courage to say that
Give me my last gift
So I can’t ever go back to you

[Chorus: Jimin, Jungkook, RM, Jungkook & RM]
I need you girl
Why am I in love alone, why am I hurting alone
I need you girl
Why do I keep needing you when I know I’ll get hurt?

I need you girl, you’re beautiful

I need you girl I need you girl
I need you girl I need you girl

36,epilogue-young-forever,"

[Verse 1: Rap Monster]
The curtain falls and I’m out of breath
I get mixed feelings as I breathe out
Did I make any mistakes today
How did the audience seem
I’m happy with who I’ve become
That I can make someone scream with joy
Still excited from the performance

[Verse 2: Suga]
I stand on the empty stage while holding onto an aftertaste that will not linger for long
While standing on this empty stage, I become afraid of this unpleasant emptiness
Within my suffocating feelings
On top of my life’s line
Without a reason, I forcibly act that I am fine
This isn’t the first time, I better get used to it
I try to hide it, but I can’t
When the heat of the show cools down
I leave the empty seats behind

[Verse 3: J-hope]
Trying to comfort myself
I tell myself the world can’t be perfect
I start to let myself go
The thundering applause, I can’t own it forever
I tell myself, so shameless
Raise your voice higher
Even if the attention isn’t forever, I’ll keep singing
As today’s me, I want eternity
Forever, I want to be young

[Chorus: V]
Forever we are young

[Jungkook]
Under the flower petals raining down
I run, so lost in this maze

[V]
Forever we are young

[Jin]
Even when I fall and hurt myself
I endlessly run toward my dream

[Jimin (Suga)]
Forever ever ever ever
(dreams, hopes, forward, forward)

[V]
Forever ever ever ever
We are young

[Jimin (Rap Monster)]
Forever ever ever ever
(dreams, hopes, forward, forward)

[Jimin]
Forever ever ever ever
We are young

[Jungkook]
Forever we are young

[Jimin]
Under the flower petals raining down
I run, so lost in this maze

[V, Jimin]
Forever we are young

[Jin]
Even when I fall and hurt myself
I keep running toward my dream

[All, Jungkook, Jimin, V]
Forever we are young
Under the flower petals raining down
I run, so lost in this maze

Forever we are young
Even when I fall and hurt myself
I keep running toward my dream

[Intro: Jimin, Jungkook]
When you say that you love me
Feels like I’m walking across the sky
Tell me about forever, just one more time
When you say that you love me
I just need those words
That you’ll never change, just one more time

[Chorus: Jin, V]
You’re everything in this world to me
Harder, so it hurts, hold me tight
We shared something
And you can’t make it nothing
I hope you don’t forget
You’re my
Day by day
Summer, winter
Even if you don’t know

[Hook 1: Jungkook, J-Hope]
You got the best of me
You got the best of me
So please just don’t leave me
You got the best of me

[Verse 1: Rap Monster]
I haven’t seen the end to myself either
But if there’s such a thing, wouldn’t it be you?
I wanted to be a warm wave
But why didn’t I know you’re the ocean?
What do I do? I’m speaking in your language
I’m breathing in your breath
I’ll be you, you hold me
I’m kissing your sword

[Verse 2: Suga]
So take my hand right now
I can’t believe myself
Words I said thousands of times only to myself
Don’t leave me
You got the best of me
You got the best of me
Whether this is a dream or reality, it’s not important
Just the fact that you’re by my side
Thanks

[Chorus: V/Jin, Jin]
Day by day
Summer, winter
Even if you don’t know

[Hook 1: Jimin, Jungkook]
You got the best of me
You got the best of me
So please just don’t leave me

You’re my salvation, you’re my shield
I just need you
You got the best of me
I need you
So please just don’t leave me
You got the best of me

[Bridge 1: Jimin, Jungkook]
It was raining
It was snowing
But all unhappiness stopped
You brought heaven to me
Don’t speak so easily
Because without you, there’s no me
You’re the best of me
The best of me

[Bridge 2: J-Hope]
Just give me assurance
That’s all I want
Even if there are no rules
Laws of love do exist
Who got the best of me?
Who got the best of me?
No one knows but I know me
My greatest master is you

[Hook 1: All]
You got the best of me
You got the best of me
So please just don’t leave me
You got the best of me

You hide but only appear when you smile
Where did you come from?
Don’t lie, I know you’re an angel
What are you?

[Verse 2: Jungkook, Jin, Jimin]
But you
That smile is so cruel
Cruel
I shouldn’t have seen that cheek
You
What’s really dangerous
Is only in your possession

[Chorus: Jungkook, Jimin, Jin, V]
That dimple is illegal ille~gal
No, it’s dangerous, oh yes
So I call you illegirl ille~girl
Your existence alone is a crime
Was it a mistake made by an angel?
Or a deep kiss?
That dimple is illegal ille~gal
But I want it anyway anyway anyway

[Verse 2: Jin, Jungkook]
I don’t have it, only you have it
Is that why it’s so hard?
I wanna die fallen in you, I wanna die locked in you
You are my lake

Cause you
When you smile, I get dizzy
True
Please be careful
You
What’s really dangerous

It’s bad so it’s better
You know on the inside
You can’t stop it now (you can’t stop)
So be honest with me

[Verse 2: Rap Monster]
Stop
Now stop watching and study for your test
Your parents and director hate me
Video clips, pictures, tweets
V app, Bon Voyage
I know, you can’t help what you like
But stop, interpret the music video later
You have so many pictures of me in your room anyway
It’s not just one hour, it’s a whole year that’ll disappear
So this song is an award I’m giving to you
Good

[Pre-Chorus: Jin, V]
You’re not being punished
Come here, I’m your paradise
Can’t close your eyes
Can’t close your eyes
You can throw a fit but it’s no use
(Don’t reject me)
Just close your eyes, tune your ears

[Chorus: Jimin, Jungkook]
Follow the sound of the pipe, follow this song
It’s a bit dangerous but I’m so sweet
I’m here to save you, I’m here to ruin you
You called me, see? I’m so sweet
Follow the sound of the pipe
I’m takin’ over you
I’m takin’ over you

[Verse 3: V, Suga]
You know that it’s already begun
The moment you hear that sound
Maybe I’m a bit dangerous
Like the pied piper
I’m testing you
Like the fruit from the tree of good and evil

[Verse 4: J-Hope]
My pipe awakens everything
That sound burns you up even more
You’re pulled by it, you react
I’m endlessly blowing
I’m your guilty pleasure
You can’t escape
Never

[Pre-Chorus: Jungkook, Jimin]
You’re not being punished
Come here, I’m your paradise
Can’t close your eyes
Can’t close your eyes
You can throw a fit but it’s no use

Just close your eyes, tune your ears

Follow the sound of the pipe, follow this song
It’s a bit dangerous but I’m so sweet
I’m here to save you, I’m here to ruin you
You called me, see? I’m so sweet
Follow the sound of the pipe

Yeah, I’m a bit dangerous
I can’t even handle myself
Don’t worry, my hands
They’re only warm for you

If I’m ruining you right now
Please forgive me
Because you can’t live without me
Because you know all of this
I’m takin’ over you
I’m takin’ over you

[Verse 1]
The light of my future is dimming
Because of my childish love, I lost my way on a path of dream
The venom of my ambition, I sharpened my knife every day
But because of my uncontrollable greed, my knife became dull
I know it all
This love is another name for the devil
Don’t hold her hand
I shouted but turned away from my conscience
I feel the sharp reality more every day
There’s red blood from being torn apart by reality
I never thought that
The greed would become the trumpet heralding hell
Breathe

[Verse 2]
My breath is getting shorter
I close my eyes every night from twisted reality
The music box of tragedy echoes
But in order to be free from this crime
It’s impossible to forget and give up
Because those lips were too sweet
I threw my future away because I was drunk on dating
When I woke up, I was surrounded by land mines
Surrounded by people’s stares that can’t be touched
I shout for a miracle in this reality
(Rewind)
It was crazy good
I was an idiot addicted to sweetness
Yeah an idiot
I didn’t want to let go of the devil’s hand

Too bad but it’s too sweet
It’s too sweet, it’s too sweet
Too bad but it’s too sweet

Now I can’t endure it anymore
Why couldn’t I say it then
I have been hurting anyway
Really, I won’t be able to endure it

[Verse 2]
Now cry
It’s only that I’m very sorry towards you
Again, cry
Because I couldn’t protect you

Deeper, deeper, the wound just gets deeper
Like pieces of broken glass that I can’t reverse
Deeper, it’s just the heart that hurts every day
You who was punished in my stead
You who were only delicate and fragile

[Verse 3]
Stop crying, tell me something
Try saying to me, who had no courage
Why did you do that to me then

[Verse 4]
I’m sorry
Forget it, what right do I have
To tell you to do this, or that

[Hook]
Deeper, deeper, the wound just gets deeper
Like pieces of broken glass that I can’t reverse
Deeper, it’s just the heart that hurts every day
You who was punished in my stead
You who were only delicate and fragile

I’m sorry I’m sorry
I’m sorry my brother
Even if I try to hide it
Or conceal it, it can’t be erased
Are you calling me a sinner
What more do I have to say

[Verse 6]
I’m sorry I’m sorry
I’m sorry my sister
Even if I try to hide it
Or conceal it, it can’t be erased
So cry
Please dry my eyes

Where I can’t turn back
The red blood is flowing down
Deeper, I feel like dying every day
Please let me be punished
Please forgive me for my sins

The corner of my memory
A brown piano settled on one side
In the corner of my childhood house
A brown piano settled on one side

Way taller than my height
The brown piano that guided me
I looked up to you, I yearned for you
When I touched you with my small finger

I feel so nice mom I feel so nice
I played the piano wherever my hands took me
I didn’t know your significance back then
Back then I was content with just looking at you

[Verse 3]
I remember back during my elementary school days
When my height
Became taller than yours
I neglected you when I once yearned for you so
On top of the white jade-like keyboard
Dust is piling on
Your image that has been neglected
Even then I didn’t know
Your significance
No matter where I am
You always defended that spot
But I didn’t know that would be the last
You say don’t leave like this

[Verse 5]
Don’t worry even if I leave
You’ll do well on your own
I remember when I first met you
Before I knew it you grew up
Though we are putting an end to our relationship
Don’t ever feel sorry to me
I will get to meet you again no matter what form
Greet me happily then

[Verse 6]
I remember back then when I met you that
I had completely forgotten, when I was around 14
The awkwardness was only for a moment, I touched you again
Even though I was gone for a long time
Without repulsion
You accepted me
Without you there’s nothing
After the dawn, two of us
We welcomed the morning together
Don’t let go of my hand forever
I won’t let go of you again either

[Verse 7]
I remember back then
We burned up the last of my teen’s
Yes the days when we couldn’t see an inch in front of us
We laughed, we cried
Those days with you, those moments are now in memories
I said, grasping my crushed shoulder
I really can’t do any more
Every time I wanted to give up
By my side you said
Bastard you can really do it
Yeah, yeah I remember back then
When I was fed up and lost
Back then when I fell into a pit of despair
Even when I pushed you away
Even when I resented meeting you
You were firmly by my side
You didn’t have to say anything
So don’t ever let go of my hand
I won’t let you go ever again either
My birth and the end of my life
You will be there to watch over it all

[Hook]
The corner of my memory
A brown piano settled on one side
In the corner of my childhood house
A brown piano settled on one side

"
46,reflection,"

[Verse 1]
I know
Every life’s a movie
We got different stars and stories
We got different nights and mornings
Our scenarios ain’t just boring
I find this movie very amusing
Everyday, I want to shoot it well
I want to caress myself
I want to caress myself
But you know, sometimes
I really really hate myself
To be honest, quite often
I really hate myself
When I really hate myself, I go to Dduksum
I just stand there with the familiar darkness
With the people that are smiling
And beer, which makes me smile
Coming to me softly
Fear, which holds my hand
It’s okay because everyone is in twos or threes
It’s good that I have a friend, too

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
The world is just another name for despair
My height is just another diameter for the earth
I am all of my joy and anxiety
It repeats everyday, the love and hate directed to me
Hey you, who’s looking over the Han River
If we bump into each other while passing, would it be fate?
Or maybe we bumped into each other in our past life
Maybe we bumped into each other countless times
In the darkness
People look happier than the day
Everyone else knows where they’re supposed to be
But only I walk without purpose
But still, blending in with them is more comfortable
Dduksum, which has swallowed up the night
Hands me an entirely different world
I want to be free
I want to be free from freedom
Because right now I’m happy but I’m unhappy
I’m looking at myself
At Dduksum

[Chorus]

[Outro]
I wish I could love myself
I wish I could love myself
I wish I could love myself
I wish I could love myself
I wish I could love myself
I wish I could love myself
I wish I could love myself
I wish I could love myself

47,mama,"

[Verse 1]
Time travel the year of 2006
Crazy for dance
I tightened my mom’s belt
Despite my dad’s opposition, every time I attacked
Without paying any concern
She floated the small boat of dreams

[Verse 2]
But I didn’t know my mom’s support
Was not a open shortcut road
But a road of dreams while gripping debt
Always
The problem of money eventually my mother
Go away
Had to work away from home

[Verse 3]
Through the phone
I could hear my mom’s voice clearly (Hello?)
The thing I remember
My mom’s strength at the time was a breaking ball to me
Really
I was determined to succeed
With that promise alone
I became the son I am now

[Hook]
Hey mama
Now you can lean on me
I’ll always be by your side
Hey mama
Because you gave selflessly to me
Because you were my support
Hey mama
Now you can believe in your son, you can smile
Hey mama
Hey mama

[Verse 4]
Hey mama
I’m sorry mama
I know now a grace like the heavens mama

[Verse 5]
Hey mama
So thanks mama
You became my blood and flesh mama

[Verse 6]
I remember mom
Moonheungdong Hiddink PC room
Broadway restaurant
A veteran who ran on both feet for her family
Failure is the mother of success mother
I learned from that passion and sincerity
Wanna be wanna be
Now when I become an adult
Because you were fertilizer to a sprout
I will become a flower and become your own flower path
You walking on way way way

[Hook]
Hey mama
Now you can lean on me
I’ll always be by your side
Hey mama
Because you gave selflessly to me
Because you were my support
Hey mama
Now you can believe in your son, you can smile
Hey mama
Hey mama

[Verse 7]
You had me feel the world
The breath you have created
Today more than usual
I want to be held in your arms
What is higher than anything above the ground
What is wider than anything beneath the sky
The only one, mother’s hand is medicine hand
You are forever my placebo

[Bridge]
I love mom

[Hook]
Hey mama
Now you can lean on me
I’ll always be by your side
Hey mama
Because you gave selflessly to me
Because you were my support
Hey mama
Now you can believe in your son, you can smile
Hey mama
Hey mama

[Outro]
Hey mama
Now you can lean on me
I’ll always be by your side
Hey mama
Because you gave selflessly to me
Because you were my support
Hey mama
Now you can believe in your son, you can smile

48,awake,"

[Verse 1]
It’s not that I believe it
But that I want to try holding out
Because this is
All that I can do

[Verse 2]
I want to remain
I want to dream more
Even so, what I’m saying is
That it’s time to leave

[Verse 3]
Yeah it’s my truth
It’s my truth
I will be covered with wounds all over

[Pre-Chorus]
But it’s my fate
It’s my fate
Still, I want to struggle and fight

[Chorus]
Maybe I, I can never fly
I can’t fly like the flower petals over there
Or as though I have wings
Maybe I, I can’t touch the sky
Still, I want to stretch my hand out
I want to run, just a bit more

[Verse 4]
I’m just walking and walking, among this darkness
My happy times asked me this question
You, are you really okay, it asked me
Oh no

[Verse 5]
I replied, no, I’m so afraid
Still, I hold the 6 flowers tightly in my hands
I, I’m just walking, I said
Oh no

[Pre-Chorus]
But it’s my fate
It’s my fate
Still, I want to struggle and fight

[Chorus]
Maybe I, I can never fly
I can’t fly like the flower petals over there
Or as though I have wings
Maybe I, I can’t touch the sky
Still, I want to stretch my hand out
I want to run, just a bit more

[Bridge]
Wide awake, wide awake, wide awake
Don’t cry
Wide awake, wide awake, wide awake
No lie
Wide awake, wide awake, wide awake
Don’t cry
Wide awake, wide awake, wide awake
No lie

[Chorus]
Maybe I, I can never fly
I can’t fly like the flower petals over there
Or as though I have wings
Maybe I, I can’t touch the sky
Still, I want to stretch my hand out
I want to run
Just a bit more

49,lost,"

[Verse 1: Jimin, Jungkook]
I’m still standing here with my eyes closed
Lost between the deserts and oceans
I’m still wandering
Where should I go yeah
I didn’t know there were this many
Paths I can’t go and paths I can’t take
I never felt this way before
Am I becoming an adult?

[Pre-Chorus: V, Jin, Jimin, Jungkook]
This is too hard, is this path right for me
I am confused
Never leave me alone
I still believe even though it’s unbelievable
To lose your path
Is the way to find that path

[Chorus: Jungkook, Jimin, V]
Lost my way
Constantly pushing without rest
Within the harsh rainstorms
Lost my way
Within a complicated world without an exit
Lost my way
Lost my way
No matter how much I wander
I want to believe in my path

[Hook: Jungkook, Jin, V, Jimin]
Lost my way
Found my way
Lost my way
Found my way

[Verse 2: Jin, Jimin]
I once saw an ant going somewhere
There is no way to find the path at once
Constantly crashing and crawling forward
To find something to eat
Roaming for days

[Verse 3: Jungkook, Jin]
You know
There is a reason for all this frustration
I believe that we’re on the right path
If we ever find it
We will return home at once
Just like an ant

[Pre-Chorus]
This is too hard, is this path right for me
I am so confused
Don’t you leave me alone
I still want to believe even though it’s unbelievable
To lose your path
Is the way to find that path

[Chorus: Jimin, Jungkook, ]
Lost my way
Constantly pushing without rest
Within the harsh rainstorms
Lost my way
Within a complicated world without an exit
Lost my way
Lost my way
I wander
I want to believe in my path

[Hook: V, Jungkook, Jimin, Jin]
So long
Goodbye to my hope with no promise
So long
Even if I’m slow I will walk with my own feet
Because I know this path is mine to take
Even if I go back, I will reach this path eventually
I never I will never
I will never lose my dream

[Bridge: Jungkook, Jimin, V]
Lost my way
Constantly pushing without rest
Within the harsh rainstorms
Lost my way
Within a complicated world without an exit
Lost my way
Lost my way
I wander
I want to believe in my path

[Outro: Jungkook, Jin, V, Jimin]
Lost my way
Found my way
Lost my way
Found my way

51,spring-day,"

[Verse 1: RM, J-Hope]
Miss you
Saying this makes me miss you even more
Miss you
Even though I’m looking at your photo
Time’s so cruel, I hate us
Seeing each other for once is now so hard between us

[Verse 2: RM]
It’s all winter here, even in August
My heart is running on the time
Alone on the Snowpiercer
Wanna get to the other side of the earth, holding your hand
Wanna put an end to this winter
How much longing should we see snowing down
To have the days of spring, Friend

[Verse 3: Jimin, V]
Like the tiny dust, tiny dust floating in the air
Will I get to you a little faster
If I was the snow in the air

[Pre-Chorus 1: Jungkook, V]
Snowflakes fall down
And get farther away little by little
I miss you (I miss you)
I miss you (I miss you)
How long do I have to wait
And how many sleepless nights do I have to spend
To see you (to see you)
To meet you (to meet you)

[Chorus: Jungkook, Jin, J-Hope]
Passing by the edge of the cold winter
Until the days of spring
Until the days of flower blossoms
Please stay, please stay there a little longer

[Verse 4: Suga, Jimin]
Is it you who changed (Is it you who changed)
Or is it me (Or is it me)
I hate this moment, this time flowing by
We are changed you know
Just like everyone you know

[Verse 5: Suga, Jimin]
Yes I hate you, you left me
But I never stopped thinking about you, not even a day
Honestly I miss you, but I’ll erase you
'Cause it hurts less than to blame you

[Verse 6: Jin, Jimin]
I try to exhale you in pain
Like smoke, like white smoke
I say that I’ll erase you
But I can’t really let you go yet

[Pre-Chorus 1: Jungkook, V]
Snowflakes fall down
And get farther away little by little
I miss you (I miss you)
I miss you (I miss you)
How long do I have to wait
And how many sleepless nights do I have to spend
To see you (to see you)
To meet you (to meet you)

[Bridge: V, Jungkook]
You know it all
You’re my best friend
The morning will come again
No darkness, no season is eternal

[Pre-Chorus 2: Jimin, Jungkook, V]
Maybe it’s cherry blossoms
And this winter will be over
I miss you (I miss you)
I miss you (I miss you)
Wait a little bit, just a few more nights
I’ll be there to see you (I'll go there to meet you)
I’ll come for you (I'll come for you)

Passing by the edge of the cold winter
Until the days of spring
Until the days of flower blossoms
Please stay, please stay there a little longer

Hey, why does God always
Make us feel lonely
Oh no no no no no no
Yeah, even if we're covered in scars
We can smile if we’re together

At the end of this road you walk alone
Will you step on it, whatever there may be
Sometimes we may get tired or sick
That’s okay, I am by your side
If you and I are together
We can smile

[J-hope]
I want to fly but
I have no wings
But your hand
Becomes my wings
I want to forget
The dark and lonely things
Together with you

These wings sprouted
From my pain
But these wings are going towards the light
Even if it's tiring and painful
I will fly if I can
Will you hold my hand
So that I won’t be afraid anymore?
If you and I are together
I can smile

[Rap Monster]
This is the path I chose
And even if they say it's fate
Because I created all of this
Even if they say it's the price
I must pay for this life

Will you walk with me?
Will you fly with me?
To the edge of the sky
So I can touch your hand
Even if it hurts like this
If you and I are together
I can smile

[Jungkook, Jimin, V, Jin]
Ayy I never walk alone
I can feel the warmth in your hand that I’m holding
Ayy you never walk alone
Feel me, you're not alone either

Come on crawl, crawl,crawl
Crawl it, like it like that
Baby walk, walk, walk
Walk it, like it like that
Baby run, run, run
Run it, like it like that
Baby fly, fly, fly
Fly it, like it like that

This road may be long and rough but
Will you stay with me?
We may fall and sometimes get hurt but
Will you stay with me?

Ayy I never walk alone
If you and I are together, we can smile[J-Hope]
Ayy you never walk alone
If you and I are together, we can smile[Rap Monster]
If you and I are together, we can smile

The world was too big and I was small
Now I can’t even imagine now
I was scentless and completely empty

I’ve been hiding it

Just to leave it buried
Now I can’t endure it anymore
Why couldn’t I say it then
I have been hurting anyway
Really, I won’t be able to endure it

Now cry
It’s only that I’m very sorry towards you
Again, cry
Because I couldn’t protect you

Deeper, deeper, the wound just gets deeper
Like pieces of broken glass that I can’t reverse
Deeper, it’s just the heart that hurts every day
You who was punished in my stead
You who were only delicate and fragile

[Verse 3]
Stop crying, tell me something
Try saying to me, who had no courage
Why did you do that to me then

[Verse 4]
I’m sorry
Forget it, what right do I have
To tell you to do this, or that

Deeper, deeper, the wound just gets deeper
Like pieces of broken glass that I can’t reverse
Deeper, it’s just the heart that hurts every day
You who was punished in my stead
You who were only delicate and fragile

I’m sorry I’m sorry
I’m sorry my brother
Even if I try to hide it
Or conceal it, it can’t be erased
Are you calling me a sinner
What more do I have to say

[Verse 6]
I’m sorry I’m sorry
I’m sorry my sister
Even if I try to hide it
Or conceal it, it can’t be erased
So cry
Please dry my eyes

That light, that light, please illuminate my sins
Where I can’t turn back
The red blood is flowing down
Deeper, I feel like dying every day
Please let me be punished
Please forgive me for my sins
Please

The corner of my memory
A brown piano settled on one side
In the corner of my childhood house
A brown piano settled on one side

[Verse 1]
I remember that moment
Way taller than my height
The brown piano that guided me
I looked up to you, I yearned for you
When I touched you with my small finger

[Verse 2]
I feel so nice mom I feel so nice
I played the piano wherever my hands took me
I didn’t know your significance back then
Back then I was content with just looking at you

[Verse 3]
I remember back during my elementary school days
When my height
Became taller than yours
I neglected you when I once yearned for you so
On top of the white jade-like keyboard
Dust is piling on
Your image that has been neglected
Even then I didn’t know
Your significance
No matter where I am
You always defended that spot
But I didn’t know that would be the last
You say don’t leave like this

[Verse 5]
Don’t worry even if I leave
You’ll do well on your own
I remember when I first met you
Before I knew it you grew up
Though we are putting an end to our relationship
Don’t ever feel sorry to me
I will get to meet you again no matter what form
Greet me happily then

[Verse 6]
I remember back then when I met you that
I had completely forgotten, when I was around 14
The awkwardness was only for a moment, I touched you again
Even though I was gone for a long time
Without repulsion
You accepted me
Without you there’s nothing
After the dawn, two of us
We welcomed the morning together
Don’t let go of my hand forever
I won’t let go of you again either

[Verse 7]
I remember back then
We burned up the last of my teen’s
Yes the days when we couldn’t see an inch in front of us
We laughed, we cried
Those days with you, those moments are now in memories
I said, grasping my crushed shoulder
I really can’t do any more
Every time I wanted to give up
By my side you said
Bastard you can really do it
Yeah, yeah I remember back then
When I was fed up and lost
Back then when I fell into a pit of despair
Even when I pushed you away
Even when I resented meeting you
You were firmly by my side
You didn’t have to say anything
So don’t ever let go of my hand
I won’t let you go ever again either
My birth and the end of my life
You will be there to watch over it all

[Hook]
The corner of my memory
A brown piano settled on one side
In the corner of my childhood house
A brown piano settled on one side

"
58,reflection,"

[Verse 1]
I know
Every life’s a movie
We got different stars and stories
We got different nights and mornings
Our scenarios ain’t just boring
I find this movie very amusing
Everyday, I want to shoot it well
I want to caress myself
I want to caress myself
But you know, sometimes
I really really hate myself
To be honest, quite often
I really hate myself
When I really hate myself, I go to Dduksum
I just stand there with the familiar darkness
With the people that are smiling
And beer, which makes me smile
Coming to me softly
Fear, which holds my hand
It’s okay because everyone is in twos or threes
It’s good that I have a friend, too

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
The world is just another name for despair
My height is just another diameter for the earth
I am all of my joy and anxiety
It repeats everyday, the love and hate directed to me
Hey you, who’s looking over the Han River
If we bump into each other while passing, would it be fate?
Or maybe we bumped into each other in our past life
Maybe we bumped into each other countless times
In the darkness
People look happier than the day
Everyone else knows where they’re supposed to be
But only I walk without purpose
But still, blending in with them is more comfortable
Dduksum, which has swallowed up the night
Hands me an entirely different world
I want to be free
I want to be free from freedom
Because right now I’m happy but I’m unhappy
I’m looking at myself
At Dduksum

[Chorus]

[Outro]
I wish I could love myself
I wish I could love myself
I wish I could love myself
I wish I could love myself
I wish I could love myself
I wish I could love myself
I wish I could love myself
I wish I could love myself

59,mama,"

[Verse 1]
Time travel the year of 2006
Crazy for dance
I tightened my mom’s belt
Despite my dad’s opposition, every time I attacked
Without paying any concern
She floated the small boat of dreams

[Verse 2]
But I didn’t know my mom’s support
Was not a open shortcut road
But a road of dreams while gripping debt
Always
The problem of money eventually my mother
Go away
Had to work away from home

[Verse 3]
Through the phone
I could hear my mom’s voice clearly (Hello?)
The thing I remember
My mom’s strength at the time was a breaking ball to me
Really
I was determined to succeed
With that promise alone
I became the son I am now

[Hook]
Hey mama
Now you can lean on me
I’ll always be by your side
Hey mama
Because you gave selflessly to me
Because you were my support
Hey mama
Now you can believe in your son, you can smile
Hey mama
Hey mama

[Verse 4]
Hey mama
I’m sorry mama
I know now a grace like the heavens mama

[Verse 5]
Hey mama
So thanks mama
You became my blood and flesh mama

[Verse 6]
I remember mom
Moonheungdong Hiddink PC room
Broadway restaurant
A veteran who ran on both feet for her family
Failure is the mother of success mother
I learned from that passion and sincerity
Wanna be wanna be
Now when I become an adult
Because you were fertilizer to a sprout
I will become a flower and become your own flower path
You walking on way way way

[Hook]
Hey mama
Now you can lean on me
I’ll always be by your side
Hey mama
Because you gave selflessly to me
Because you were my support
Hey mama
Now you can believe in your son, you can smile
Hey mama
Hey mama

[Verse 7]
You had me feel the world
The breath you have created
Today more than usual
I want to be held in your arms
What is higher than anything above the ground
What is wider than anything beneath the sky
The only one, mother’s hand is medicine hand
You are forever my placebo

[Bridge]
I love mom

[Hook]
Hey mama
Now you can lean on me
I’ll always be by your side
Hey mama
Because you gave selflessly to me
Because you were my support
Hey mama
Now you can believe in your son, you can smile
Hey mama
Hey mama

[Outro]
Hey mama
Now you can lean on me
I’ll always be by your side
Hey mama
Because you gave selflessly to me
Because you were my support
Hey mama
Now you can believe in your son, you can smile
Hey mama
Hey mama

60,awake,"

[Verse 1]
It’s not that I believe it
But that I want to try holding out
Because this is
All that I can do

[Verse 2]
I want to remain
I want to dream more
Even so, what I’m saying is
That it’s time to leave

[Verse 3]
Yeah it’s my truth
It’s my truth
I will be covered with wounds all over

[Pre-Chorus]
But it’s my fate
It’s my fate
Still, I want to struggle and fight

[Chorus]
Maybe I, I can never fly
I can’t fly like the flower petals over there
Or as though I have wings
Maybe I, I can’t touch the sky
Still, I want to stretch my hand out
I want to run, just a bit more

[Verse 4]
I’m just walking and walking, among this darkness
My happy times asked me this question
You, are you really okay, it asked me
Oh no

[Verse 5]
I replied, no, I’m so afraid
Still, I hold the 6 flowers tightly in my hands
I, I’m just walking, I said
Oh no

[Pre-Chorus]
But it’s my fate
It’s my fate
Still, I want to struggle and fight

[Chorus]
Maybe I, I can never fly
I can’t fly like the flower petals over there
Or as though I have wings
Maybe I, I can’t touch the sky
Still, I want to stretch my hand out
I want to run, just a bit more

[Bridge]
Wide awake, wide awake, wide awake
Don’t cry
Wide awake, wide awake, wide awake
No lie
Wide awake, wide awake, wide awake
Don’t cry
Wide awake, wide awake, wide awake
No lie

[Chorus]
Maybe I, I can never fly
I can’t fly like the flower petals over there
Or as though I have wings
Maybe I, I can’t touch the sky
Still, I want to stretch my hand out
I want to run
Just a bit more

61,lost,"

[Verse 1: Jimin, Jungkook]
I’m still standing here with my eyes closed
Lost between the deserts and oceans
I’m still wandering
Where should I go yeah
I didn’t know there were this many
Paths I can’t go and paths I can’t take
I never felt this way before
Am I becoming an adult?

[Pre-Chorus: V, Jin, Jimin, Jungkook]
This is too hard, is this path right for me
I am confused
Never leave me alone
I still believe even though it’s unbelievable
To lose your path
Is the way to find that path

[Chorus: Jungkook, Jimin, V]
Lost my way
Constantly pushing without rest
Within the harsh rainstorms
Lost my way
Within a complicated world without an exit
Lost my way
Lost my way
No matter how much I wander
I want to believe in my path

[Hook: Jungkook, Jin, V, Jimin]
Lost my way
Found my way
Lost my way
Found my way

[Verse 2: Jin, Jimin]
I once saw an ant going somewhere
There is no way to find the path at once
Constantly crashing and crawling forward
To find something to eat
Roaming for days

[Verse 3: Jungkook, Jin]
You know
There is a reason for all this frustration
I believe that we’re on the right path
If we ever find it
We will return home at once
Just like an ant

[Pre-Chorus]
This is too hard, is this path right for me
I am so confused
Don’t you leave me alone
I still want to believe even though it’s unbelievable
To lose your path
Is the way to find that path

[Chorus: Jimin, Jungkook, ]
Lost my way
Constantly pushing without rest
Within the harsh rainstorms
Lost my way
Within a complicated world without an exit
Lost my way
Lost my way
I wander
I want to believe in my path

[Hook: V, Jungkook, Jimin, Jin]
So long
Goodbye to my hope with no promise
So long
Even if I’m slow I will walk with my own feet
Because I know this path is mine to take
Even if I go back, I will reach this path eventually
I never I will never
I will never lose my dream

[Bridge: Jungkook, Jimin, V]
Lost my way
Constantly pushing without rest
Within the harsh rainstorms
Lost my way
Within a complicated world without an exit
Lost my way
Lost my way
I wander
I want to believe in my path

[Outro: Jungkook, Jin, V, Jimin]
Lost my way
Found my way
Lost my way
Found my way

63,spring-day,"

[Verse 1: RM, J-Hope]
Miss you
Saying this makes me miss you even more
Miss you
Even though I’m looking at your photo
Time’s so cruel, I hate us
Seeing each other for once is now so hard between us

[Verse 2: RM]
It’s all winter here, even in August
My heart is running on the time
Alone on the Snowpiercer
Wanna get to the other side of the earth, holding your hand
Wanna put an end to this winter
How much longing should we see snowing down
To have the days of spring, Friend

[Verse 3: Jimin, V]
Like the tiny dust, tiny dust floating in the air
Will I get to you a little faster
If I was the snow in the air

[Pre-Chorus 1: Jungkook, V]
Snowflakes fall down
And get farther away little by little
I miss you (I miss you)
I miss you (I miss you)
How long do I have to wait
And how many sleepless nights do I have to spend
To see you (to see you)
To meet you (to meet you)

[Chorus: Jungkook, Jin, J-Hope]
Passing by the edge of the cold winter
Until the days of spring
Until the days of flower blossoms
Please stay, please stay there a little longer

[Verse 4: Suga, Jimin]
Is it you who changed (Is it you who changed)
Or is it me (Or is it me)
I hate this moment, this time flowing by
We are changed you know
Just like everyone you know

[Verse 5: Suga, Jimin]
Yes I hate you, you left me
But I never stopped thinking about you, not even a day
Honestly I miss you, but I’ll erase you
'Cause it hurts less than to blame you

[Verse 6: Jin, Jimin]
I try to exhale you in pain
Like smoke, like white smoke
I say that I’ll erase you
But I can’t really let you go yet

[Pre-Chorus 1: Jungkook, V]
Snowflakes fall down
And get farther away little by little
I miss you (I miss you)
I miss you (I miss you)
How long do I have to wait
And how many sleepless nights do I have to spend
To see you (to see you)
To meet you (to meet you)

[Bridge: V, Jungkook]
You know it all
You’re my best friend
The morning will come again
No darkness, no season is eternal

[Pre-Chorus 2: Jimin, Jungkook, V]
Maybe it’s cherry blossoms
And this winter will be over
I miss you (I miss you)
I miss you (I miss you)
Wait a little bit, just a few more nights
I’ll be there to see you (I'll go there to meet you)
I’ll come for you (I'll come for you)

[Chorus: Jungkook, J-Hope, Jin ]
Passing by the edge of the cold winter
Until the days of spring
Until the days of flower blossoms
Please stay, please stay there a little longer

But it is not today

65,intro-boy-meets-evil,"

[Verse 1]
The light of my future is dimming
Because of my childish love, I lost my way on a path of dream
The venom of my ambition, I sharpened my knife every day
But because of my uncontrollable greed, my knife became dull
I know it all
This love is another name for the devil
Don’t hold her hand
I shouted but turned away from my conscience
I feel the sharp reality more every day
There’s red blood from being torn apart by reality
I never thought that
The greed would become the trumpet heralding hell
Breathe

[Verse 2]
My breath is getting shorter
I close my eyes every night from twisted reality
The music box of tragedy echoes
But in order to be free from this crime
It’s impossible to forget and give up
Because those lips were too sweet
I threw my future away because I was drunk on dating
When I woke up, I was surrounded by land mines
Surrounded by people’s stares that can’t be touched
I shout for a miracle in this reality
(Rewind)
It was crazy good
I was an idiot addicted to sweetness
Yeah an idiot
I didn’t want to let go of the devil’s hand

[Refrain]
Too bad but it’s too sweet
It’s too sweet, it’s too sweet
Too bad but it’s too sweet
It’s too sweet, it’s too sweet
Too bad but it’s too sweet
It’s too sweet, it’s too sweet
Too bad but it’s too sweet
It’s too sweet, it’s too sweet

When I was fifteen years old, I had nothing
The world was too big and I was small
Now I can’t even imagine now
I was scentless and completely empty

Love you my brother, I’ve got brothers
I discovered emotions, I became me
So I’m me
Now I’m me

You make me begin
You make me begin
You make me begin
(Smile with me, smile with me
Smile with me)
You make me begin

I can’t take it anymore
Because you are crying
I want to cry in your place
Although I can’t

[Hook]
You make me begin
You make me begin
You make me begin
(Cry with me, cry with me
Cry with me)
You make me begin
(Cry with me, cry with me)

[Verse 4]
I feel like dying
When my brother is sad
When my brother is sick
It hurts more than when I’m sick

[Verse 5]
Brother let’s cry, cry, cry and get it over with
I don’t know much about sadness
But I’m gonna cry anyway
Because, because

You made me again

(Ah woo woo)
Get away away away from me
Get away away from me
(Ah woo woo)
Whoever it may be, save me, me
Save me
It continues even when I run away
I am caught in a lie

Caught in a lie
Find me when I was pure
I can’t be free from this lie
Give me back my smile
Caught in a lie
Pull me from this hell
I can’t be free from this pain
Save me, I am being punished

You want me
I’ve lost my way
You want me
Just like me every day
I feel so far away
You always come my way
It repeats all over again

Get away away away from me
Get away away from me

Give me back my smile
Caught in a lie
Pull me from this hell

I am still the same person I was before
I am here, the same person I was from before, but
An overgrown lie is trying to swallow me whole

Caught in a lie
Find me when I was pure

Give me back my smile
Caught in a lie

68,stigma,"

[Verse 1]
I’ve been hiding it
I tell you something
Just to leave it buried
Now I can’t endure it anymore
Why couldn’t I say it then
I have been hurting anyway
Really, I won’t be able to endure it

[Verse 2]
Now cry
It’s only that I’m very sorry towards you
Again, cry
Because I couldn’t protect you

[Hook]
Deeper, deeper, the wound just gets deeper
Like pieces of broken glass that I can’t reverse
Deeper, it’s just the heart that hurts every day
You who was punished in my stead
You who were only delicate and fragile

[Verse 3]
Stop crying, tell me something
Try saying to me, who had no courage
Why did you do that to me then

[Verse 4]
I’m sorry
Forget it, what right do I have
To tell you to do this, or that

[Hook]
Deeper, deeper, the wound just gets deeper
Like pieces of broken glass that I can’t reverse
Deeper, it’s just the heart that hurts every day
You who was punished in my stead
You who were only delicate and fragile

[Verse 5]
I’m sorry I’m sorry
I’m sorry my brother
Even if I try to hide it
Or conceal it, it can’t be erased
Are you calling me a sinner
What more do I have to say

[Verse 6]
I’m sorry I’m sorry
I’m sorry my sister
Even if I try to hide it
Or conceal it, it can’t be erased
So cry
Please dry my eyes

[Outro]
That light, that light, please illuminate my sins
Where I can’t turn back
The red blood is flowing down
Deeper, I feel like dying every day
Please let me be punished
Please forgive me for my sins
Please

The corner of my memory
A brown piano settled on one side
In the corner of my childhood house
A brown piano settled on one side

[Verse 1]
I remember that moment
Way taller than my height
The brown piano that guided me
I looked up to you, I yearned for you
When I touched you with my small finger

[Verse 2]
I feel so nice mom I feel so nice
I played the piano wherever my hands took me
I didn’t know your significance back then
Back then I was content with just looking at you

[Verse 3]
I remember back during my elementary school days
When my height
Became taller than yours
I neglected you when I once yearned for you so
On top of the white jade-like keyboard
Dust is piling on
Your image that has been neglected
Even then I didn’t know
Your significance
No matter where I am
You always defended that spot
But I didn’t know that would be the last
You say don’t leave like this

[Verse 5]
Don’t worry even if I leave
You’ll do well on your own
I remember when I first met you
Before I knew it you grew up
Though we are putting an end to our relationship
Don’t ever feel sorry to me
I will get to meet you again no matter what form
Greet me happily then

[Verse 6]
I remember back then when I met you that
I had completely forgotten, when I was around 14
The awkwardness was only for a moment, I touched you again
Even though I was gone for a long time
Without repulsion
You accepted me
Without you there’s nothing
After the dawn, two of us
We welcomed the morning together
Don’t let go of my hand forever
I won’t let go of you again either

[Verse 7]
I remember back then
We burned up the last of my teen’s
Yes the days when we couldn’t see an inch in front of us
We laughed, we cried
Those days with you, those moments are now in memories
I said, grasping my crushed shoulder
I really can’t do any more
Every time I wanted to give up
By my side you said
Bastard you can really do it
Yeah, yeah I remember back then
When I was fed up and lost
Back then when I fell into a pit of despair
Even when I pushed you away
Even when I resented meeting you
You were firmly by my side
You didn’t have to say anything
So don’t ever let go of my hand
I won’t let you go ever again either
My birth and the end of my life
You will be there to watch over it all

70,reflection,"

[Verse 1]
I know
Every life’s a movie
We got different stars and stories
We got different nights and mornings
Our scenarios ain’t just boring
I find this movie very amusing
Everyday, I want to shoot it well
I want to caress myself
I want to caress myself
But you know, sometimes
I really really hate myself
To be honest, quite often
I really hate myself
When I really hate myself, I go to Dduksum
I just stand there with the familiar darkness
With the people that are smiling
And beer, which makes me smile
Coming to me softly
Fear, which holds my hand
It’s okay because everyone is in twos or threes
It’s good that I have a friend, too

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
The world is just another name for despair
My height is just another diameter for the earth
I am all of my joy and anxiety
It repeats everyday, the love and hate directed to me
Hey you, who’s looking over the Han River
If we bump into each other while passing, would it be fate?
Or maybe we bumped into each other in our past life
Maybe we bumped into each other countless times
In the darkness
People look happier than the day
Everyone else knows where they’re supposed to be
But only I walk without purpose
But still, blending in with them is more comfortable
Dduksum, which has swallowed up the night
Hands me an entirely different world
I want to be free
I want to be free from freedom
Because right now I’m happy but I’m unhappy
I’m looking at myself
At Dduksum

[Chorus]

[Outro]
I wish I could love myself
I wish I could love myself
I wish I could love myself
I wish I could love myself
I wish I could love myself
I wish I could love myself
I wish I could love myself
I wish I could love myself

I tightened my mom’s belt
Despite my dad’s opposition, every time I attacked
Without paying any concern
She floated the small boat of dreams

[Verse 2]
But I didn’t know my mom’s support
Was not a open shortcut road
But a road of dreams while gripping debt
Always
The problem of money eventually my mother
Go away
Had to work away from home

[Verse 3]
Through the phone
I could hear my mom’s voice clearly (Hello?)
The thing I remember
My mom’s strength at the time was a breaking ball to me
Really
I was determined to succeed
With that promise alone
I became the son I am now

[Hook]
Hey mama
Now you can lean on me
I’ll always be by your side
Hey mama
Because you gave selflessly to me
Because you were my support
Hey mama
Now you can believe in your son, you can smile
Hey mama
Hey mama

[Verse 4]
Hey mama
I’m sorry mama
I know now a grace like the heavens mama

[Verse 5]
Hey mama
So thanks mama
You became my blood and flesh mama

[Verse 6]
I remember mom
Moonheungdong Hiddink PC room
Broadway restaurant
A veteran who ran on both feet for her family
Failure is the mother of success mother
I learned from that passion and sincerity
Wanna be wanna be
Now when I become an adult
Because you were fertilizer to a sprout
I will become a flower and become your own flower path
You walking on way way way

[Hook]
Hey mama
Now you can lean on me
I’ll always be by your side
Hey mama
Because you gave selflessly to me
Because you were my support
Hey mama
Now you can believe in your son, you can smile
Hey mama
Hey mama

[Verse 7]
You had me feel the world
The breath you have created
Today more than usual
I want to be held in your arms
What is higher than anything above the ground
What is wider than anything beneath the sky
The only one, mother’s hand is medicine hand
You are forever my placebo

[Bridge]
I love mom

[Hook]
Hey mama
Now you can lean on me
I’ll always be by your side
Hey mama
Because you gave selflessly to me
Because you were my support
Hey mama
Now you can believe in your son, you can smile
Hey mama
Hey mama

[Outro]
Hey mama
Now you can lean on me
I’ll always be by your side
Hey mama
Because you gave selflessly to me
Because you were my support
Hey mama
Now you can believe in your son, you can smile

72,awake,"

[Verse 1]
It’s not that I believe it
But that I want to try holding out
Because this is
All that I can do

[Verse 2]
I want to remain
I want to dream more
Even so, what I’m saying is
That it’s time to leave

[Verse 3]
Yeah it’s my truth
It’s my truth
I will be covered with wounds all over

[Pre-Chorus]
But it’s my fate
It’s my fate
Still, I want to struggle and fight

[Chorus]
Maybe I, I can never fly
I can’t fly like the flower petals over there
Or as though I have wings
Maybe I, I can’t touch the sky
Still, I want to stretch my hand out
I want to run, just a bit more

[Verse 4]
I’m just walking and walking, among this darkness
My happy times asked me this question
You, are you really okay, it asked me
Oh no

[Verse 5]
I replied, no, I’m so afraid
Still, I hold the 6 flowers tightly in my hands
I, I’m just walking, I said
Oh no

[Pre-Chorus]
But it’s my fate
It’s my fate
Still, I want to struggle and fight

[Chorus]
Maybe I, I can never fly
I can’t fly like the flower petals over there
Or as though I have wings
Maybe I, I can’t touch the sky
Still, I want to stretch my hand out
I want to run, just a bit more

[Bridge]
Wide awake, wide awake, wide awake
Don’t cry
Wide awake, wide awake, wide awake
No lie
Wide awake, wide awake, wide awake
Don’t cry
Wide awake, wide awake, wide awake
No lie

[Chorus]
Maybe I, I can never fly
I can’t fly like the flower petals over there
Or as though I have wings
Maybe I, I can’t touch the sky
Still, I want to stretch my hand out
I want to run
Just a bit more

73,lost,"

[Verse 1: Jimin, Jungkook]
I’m still standing here with my eyes closed
Lost between the deserts and oceans
I’m still wandering
Where should I go yeah
I didn’t know there were this many
Paths I can’t go and paths I can’t take
I never felt this way before
Am I becoming an adult?

[Pre-Chorus: V, Jin, Jimin, Jungkook]
This is too hard, is this path right for me
I am confused
Never leave me alone
I still believe even though it’s unbelievable
To lose your path
Is the way to find that path

[Chorus: Jungkook, Jimin, V]
Lost my way
Constantly pushing without rest
Within the harsh rainstorms
Lost my way
Within a complicated world without an exit
Lost my way
Lost my way
No matter how much I wander
I want to believe in my path

[Hook: Jungkook, Jin, V, Jimin]
Lost my way
Found my way
Lost my way
Found my way

[Verse 2: Jin, Jimin]
I once saw an ant going somewhere
There is no way to find the path at once
Constantly crashing and crawling forward
To find something to eat
Roaming for days

[Verse 3: Jungkook, Jin]
You know
There is a reason for all this frustration
I believe that we’re on the right path
If we ever find it
We will return home at once
Just like an ant

[Pre-Chorus]
This is too hard, is this path right for me
I am so confused
Don’t you leave me alone
I still want to believe even though it’s unbelievable
To lose your path
Is the way to find that path

[Chorus: Jimin, Jungkook, ]
Lost my way
Constantly pushing without rest
Within the harsh rainstorms
Lost my way
Within a complicated world without an exit
Lost my way
Lost my way
I wander
I want to believe in my path

[Hook: V, Jungkook, Jimin, Jin]
So long
Goodbye to my hope with no promise
So long
Even if I’m slow I will walk with my own feet
Because I know this path is mine to take
Even if I go back, I will reach this path eventually
I never I will never
I will never lose my dream

[Bridge: Jungkook, Jimin, V]
Lost my way
Constantly pushing without rest
Within the harsh rainstorms
Lost my way
Within a complicated world without an exit
Lost my way
Lost my way
I wander
I want to believe in my path

Lost my way
Found my way

[Intro: Jungkook]
Take me to the sky

[RM]
Put your hands up to the sky, yeah
If you're feelin' the vibe, c'mon
If you're ready to fly
Let's do it

[Verse 1: J-Hope]
Remember when I was a child
I didn’t have big worries
This small feather was going to become my wings
And with those wings, I was going to fly
I believed and I was full of faith
And laughter

[Verse 2: RM]
(Like a bird)
I went down a path people told me not to
I did things people told me not to
I wanted things I should not want
I would be hurt, hurt again
You can call me stupid
Then I just smirk
I don’t want to be successful
Doing something I don’t want to do
I push myself
Word

[Verse 3: Suga]
I believe in myself, my back hurts because
It’s to sprout my wings
I believe in you, I may be weak now
But in the end, it will be an incredible jump
Fly, fly up in the sky
Fly, fly get ’em up high
This is the path you chose dude, don’t doubt yourself
This is only the first flight uh

[Chorus: Jungkook, V]
Take me to the sky
If I can fly free
If I can run away forever

[Hook: Jimin, Jin, V]
If my wings could fly
I would pierce through
The heavy air and fly
I fly, I fly, I fly

[Jungkook, Jin]
Higher than higher than
Higher than the sky
I fly, I fly, I fly
Beat my red wings with all my might

[Bridge: Together, Jungkook]
Spread spread spread my wings
Lala lalalala, lala lalalala
[Jimin, Jungkook]
Spread spread spread my wings
Lala lalalala, lala lalalala

[Outro: Jungkook, V]
Wings are made to fly fly fly
Fly fly fly
If my wings could fly

75,begin,"

[Verse 1]
When I was fifteen years old, I had nothing
The world was too big and I was small
Now I can’t even imagine now
I was scentless and completely empty
I pray

[Verse 2]
Love you my brother, I’ve got brothers
I discovered emotions, I became me
So I’m me
Now I’m me

[Hook]
You make me begin
You make me begin
You make me begin
(Smile with me, smile with me
Smile with me)
You make me begin
(Smile with me, smile with me)

[Verse 2]
I can’t take it anymore
Because you are crying
I want to cry in your place
Although I can’t

[Hook]
You make me begin
You make me begin
You make me begin
(Cry with me, cry with me
Cry with me)
You make me begin
(Cry with me, cry with me)

[Verse 4]
I feel like dying
When my brother is sad
When my brother is sick
It hurts more than when I’m sick

[Verse 5]
Brother let’s cry, cry, cry and get it over with
I don’t know much about sadness
But I’m gonna cry anyway
Because, because

[Hook]
You made me again
You made me again
You made me again

Fly with me)
You made me again

76,lie,"

[Verse 1]
Tell me
With your sweet smile
Tell me
Tell me like you’re whispering in my ear
Don’t be like a prey
(Be) Smooth like a like a snake
I want to get away

[Pre-Chorus]
(Ah woo woo)
Get away away away from me
Get away away from me
(Ah woo woo)
Whoever it may be, save me, me
Save me
It continues even when I run away
I am caught in a lie

[Chorus]
Caught in a lie
Find me when I was pure
I can’t be free from this lie
Give me back my smile
Caught in a lie
Pull me from this hell
I can’t be free from this pain
Save me, I am being punished

[Verse 2]
You want me
I’ve lost my way
You want me
Just like me every day
I feel so far away
You always come my way
It repeats all over again

[Pre-Chorus]
(Ah woo woo)
Get away away away from me
Get away away from me
(Ah woo woo)
Whoever it may be, save me, me
Save me
It continues even when I run away

Give me back my smile
Caught in a lie
Pull me from this hell
I can’t be free from this pain
Save me, I am being punished

[Bridge]
I am still the same person I was before
I am here, the same person I was from before, but
An overgrown lie is trying to swallow me whole

[Chorus]
Caught in a lie
Find me when I was pure
I can’t be free from this lie
Give me back my smile
Caught in a lie
Pull me from this hell
I can’t be free from this pain
Save me, I am being punished

77,stigma,"

[Verse 1]
I’ve been hiding it
I tell you something
Just to leave it buried
Now I can’t endure it anymore
Why couldn’t I say it then
I have been hurting anyway
Really, I won’t be able to endure it

[Verse 2]
Now cry
It’s only that I’m very sorry towards you
Again, cry
Because I couldn’t protect you

[Hook]
Deeper, deeper, the wound just gets deeper
Like pieces of broken glass that I can’t reverse
Deeper, it’s just the heart that hurts every day
You who was punished in my stead
You who were only delicate and fragile

[Verse 3]
Stop crying, tell me something
Try saying to me, who had no courage
Why did you do that to me then

[Verse 4]
I’m sorry
Forget it, what right do I have
To tell you to do this, or that

[Hook]
Deeper, deeper, the wound just gets deeper
Like pieces of broken glass that I can’t reverse
Deeper, it’s just the heart that hurts every day
You who was punished in my stead
You who were only delicate and fragile

[Verse 5]
I’m sorry I’m sorry
I’m sorry my brother
Even if I try to hide it
Or conceal it, it can’t be erased
Are you calling me a sinner
What more do I have to say

[Verse 6]
I’m sorry I’m sorry
I’m sorry my sister
Even if I try to hide it
Or conceal it, it can’t be erased
So cry
Please dry my eyes

[Outro]
That light, that light, please illuminate my sins
Where I can’t turn back
The red blood is flowing down
Deeper, I feel like dying every day
Please let me be punished
Please forgive me for my sins
Please

The corner of my memory
A brown piano settled on one side
In the corner of my childhood house
A brown piano settled on one side

[Verse 1]
I remember that moment
Way taller than my height
The brown piano that guided me
I looked up to you, I yearned for you
When I touched you with my small finger

[Verse 2]
I feel so nice mom I feel so nice
I played the piano wherever my hands took me
I didn’t know your significance back then
Back then I was content with just looking at you

[Verse 3]
I remember back during my elementary school days
When my height
Became taller than yours
I neglected you when I once yearned for you so
On top of the white jade-like keyboard
Dust is piling on
Your image that has been neglected
Even then I didn’t know
Your significance
No matter where I am
You always defended that spot
But I didn’t know that would be the last
You say don’t leave like this

[Verse 5]
Don’t worry even if I leave
You’ll do well on your own
I remember when I first met you
Before I knew it you grew up
Though we are putting an end to our relationship
Don’t ever feel sorry to me
I will get to meet you again no matter what form
Greet me happily then

[Verse 6]
I remember back then when I met you that
I had completely forgotten, when I was around 14
The awkwardness was only for a moment, I touched you again
Even though I was gone for a long time
Without repulsion
You accepted me
Without you there’s nothing
After the dawn, two of us
We welcomed the morning together
Don’t let go of my hand forever
I won’t let go of you again either

[Verse 7]
I remember back then
We burned up the last of my teen’s
Yes the days when we couldn’t see an inch in front of us
We laughed, we cried
Those days with you, those moments are now in memories
I said, grasping my crushed shoulder
I really can’t do any more
Every time I wanted to give up
By my side you said
Bastard you can really do it
Yeah, yeah I remember back then
When I was fed up and lost
Back then when I fell into a pit of despair
Even when I pushed you away
Even when I resented meeting you
You were firmly by my side
You didn’t have to say anything
So don’t ever let go of my hand
I won’t let you go ever again either
My birth and the end of my life
You will be there to watch over it all

[Hook]
The corner of my memory
A brown piano settled on one side
In the corner of my childhood house
A brown piano settled on one side

79,reflection,"

[Verse 1]
I know
Every life’s a movie
We got different stars and stories
We got different nights and mornings
Our scenarios ain’t just boring
I find this movie very amusing
Everyday, I want to shoot it well
I want to caress myself
I want to caress myself
But you know, sometimes
I really really hate myself
To be honest, quite often
I really hate myself
When I really hate myself, I go to Dduksum
I just stand there with the familiar darkness
With the people that are smiling
And beer, which makes me smile
Coming to me softly
Fear, which holds my hand
It’s okay because everyone is in twos or threes
It’s good that I have a friend, too

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
The world is just another name for despair
My height is just another diameter for the earth
I am all of my joy and anxiety
It repeats everyday, the love and hate directed to me
Hey you, who’s looking over the Han River
If we bump into each other while passing, would it be fate?
Or maybe we bumped into each other in our past life
Maybe we bumped into each other countless times
In the darkness
People look happier than the day
Everyone else knows where they’re supposed to be
But only I walk without purpose
But still, blending in with them is more comfortable
Dduksum, which has swallowed up the night
Hands me an entirely different world
I want to be free
I want to be free from freedom
Because right now I’m happy but I’m unhappy
I’m looking at myself
At Dduksum

[Chorus]

[Outro]
I wish I could love myself
I wish I could love myself
I wish I could love myself
I wish I could love myself
I wish I could love myself
I wish I could love myself
I wish I could love myself
I wish I could love myself

I need you girl I need you girl

[Verse 4: RM, V]
It goes round & round, why do I keep coming back
I go down & down, at this point, I’m just a fool
Whatever I do, I can’t help it
It’s definitely my heart, my feelings but why don’t they listen to me
I’m just talking to myself again, talking to myself again
I’m just talking to myself again, talking to myself again
You’re not saying anything, please, I’ll treat you well
But the sky is blue, the sky is blue

[Verse 5: Jin]
The sky is blue and the sun is shining
So my tears are even more noticeable
Why is it you? Why did it have to be you?
Why can’t I leave you?

[Chorus: Jungkook, Jimin, RM, Jungkook & RM]
I need you girl
Why am I in love alone, why am I hurting alone
I need you girl
Why do I keep needing you when I know I’ll get hurt?

I need you girl, you’re beautiful
I need you girl, you’re so cold
I need you girl I need you girl
I need you girl I need you girl

[Bridge: Jin, V, Jungkook, Jimin]
Girl, just tell me you wanna break up
Girl, just tell me it wasn’t love
I have no courage to say that
Give me my last gift
So I can’t ever go back to you

[Chorus: Jimin, Jungkook, RM, Jungkook & RM]
I need you girl
Why am I in love alone, why am I hurting alone
I need you girl
Why do I keep needing you when I know I’ll get hurt?

I need you girl, you’re beautiful
I need you girl, you’re so cold
I need you girl I need you girl
I need you girl I need you girl

[Verse 2: Jungkook]
Your eyebrows slightly grimacing at the sunlight
Gently shaking your fine soft hair
Intoxicated by your scent, my heart is tickling

[Jin]
Like the way you are stroking my cheeks
Like the dust drifting along freely
You’re right there but why are you beyond my reach

You’re my sun, one and only in this world
I bloom for you, but you make me thirsty
It’s too late, too late
I can’t live without you
Even if I‘m drying out, I try harder to reach you

[Verse 1: Suga]
But it’s no use, it’s a dream to be broken
I run and run, but I’m not getting anywhere
Just burn me out, yes
Keep pushing me away
This is a fool, crazy in love, chasing in circles

[Pre-Chorus: V]
Make me run
Make me run more
Let my feet rip apart with wounds
At least I can I smile when I see you

[Chorus]
I run, run, run
I can’t stop
Run, run, run again
I can’t help it
This is all I can do anyway
All I know is how to love you

Run, run, run again
It’s okay to fall
Run, run. Run, again
It’s okay to get hurt
I’m alright, even if I can’t have you
Pitiful destiny, point your finger at me

(Run)
Don’t tell me bye bye

You make me cry cry

Love is a lie lie
Don’t tell me, don’t tell me
Don’t tell me bye bye

[Verse 3: J-Hope]
Everyone says it’s over, but I can’t stop
Is this sweat or tear, I can’t really tell oh
My love stripped bare, the stormy winds
They make me run again, my heart beats again

[Pre-Chorus: Jin]
Make me run
Make me run more
Let my feet rip apart with wounds
At least I can I smile when I see you

[Chorus]
I run, run, run
I can’t stop
Run, run, run again

This is all I can do anyway
All I know is how to love you

Run, run, run again
It’s okay to fall
Run, run. Run, again
It’s okay to get hurt
I’m alright, even if I can’t have you
Pitiful destiny, point your finger at me

[Bridge: V, Jungkook, Jin]
Memories crumble like dried flower petals
At the tip of my fingers, under my feet
Right behind your back
I’m chasing butterflies, so lost in dreams
I follow your traces
Show me the way, please stop me
Let me breathe

[Chorus]
I run, run, run
I can’t stop
Run, run, run again
I can’t help it
This is all I can do anyway
All I know is how to love you

Yeah I’ll be ridin' and I’ll be dyin’
In ma city

[Verse 1: Rap Monster]
I don’t know what to say
Even if I die, I can’t tell
Even if you give me a hundred thousand dollars to live somewhere else
Ah, no thanks
Ilsan is where I want to be buried even after I die
It’s the city of the flower, city of Mon
La Festa and the Western Dom that are like home
The Hugok Academy that raised me during my young years, uh
The most harmonious place in the world, uh
Nature and the city’s building and flowers, uh
Me, who likes the Ilsan Lake Park more than the Han River
Will hug you much more warmly, even though we’re small
When I feel like I’m forgetting myself
In that place, I find my old self
(I) remember everything, even your smell
You’re my summer autumn
Winter and every spring

[Pre-Chorus: Jimin, V, Jin]
The Busan beach there

I’m a South Jeollado, Gwangju's baby
Even if my footsteps go to the mountains
It always goes to the summit of Mt. Mudeung, every day
My life is hot, the heat of the south
There’s no such thing as giving up on the law of this fierce heat
I put on a KIA and I turn on the engine
Bounce like crazy
With just one dance I raise my big dream of being a singer
Now in front of reality (I do) music and I jump on stage
Everyone saw, right? I put in passion
I’m Gwangju’s hoshigi, the country’s 8 provinces gear up
If you want to see me then gather at 7
Everyone dial it, 062 - 518

I was born in Daegu, I was brought up in Daegu
It’s a bit difficult to get a blood transfusion
My blue blood inside my body
This bastard in every album
Talks about Daegu
And doesn’t seem to get bored of it
You can think like that but
I’m a D-boy, that’s right I’m a D-boy
Honestly speaking, in Daegu
There’s nothing much to boast about
My birth is in itself, Daegu’s pride
Right? Ah alright
There’s nothing to boast
But I can’t help but be proud, right?
Ayo, I’m the most successful guy born in Daegu
You will hear this kind of thing, listen well now
I’m Daegu’s pride, a new generation, a new wind
Daegu’s past, present, and future

88,save-me,"

I want to breathe, I hate this night
I want to wake up, I hate this dream
I’m trapped inside of myself and I’m dead
Don’t wanna be lonely
Just wanna be yours

Why is it so dark where you’re not here
It’s dangerous how wrecked I am
Save me because I can’t get a grip on myself

Listen to my heartbeat
It calls you whenever it wants to
Because within this pitch black darkness
You are shining so brightly

Give me your hand
Save me save me
I need your love before
I fall, fall
Give me your hand save me save me
I need your love before I fall, fall

Give me your hand save me save me
Give me your hand save me save me

Save me, save me

Today the moon shines brighter on the blank spot in my memories
It swallowed me, this lunatic, please save me tonight
(Please save me tonight, please save me tonight)
Within this childish madness you will save me tonight

I knew that your salvation
Is a part of my life and the only helping hand that will embrace my pain
The best of me, you’re the only thing I have
Please raise your voice so that I can laugh again
Play on

Listen to my heartbeat, it calls you whenever it wants to
Because within this pitch black darkness, you are shining so brightly

Give me your hand save me save me
I need your love before I fall, fall
Give me your hand save me save me
I need your love before I fall, fall

Give me your hand save me save me
Give me your hand save me save me

Thank you for letting me be me
For helping me fly
For giving me wings
For straightening me out
For waking me from being suffocated
For waking me from a dream which was all I was living in
When I think of you the sun comes out
So I gave my sadness to the dog
(Thank you. For being ‘us’)

Give me your hand save me save me
I need your love before I fall, fall
Give me your hand save me save me
I need your love before I fall, fall

[Verse 1: Rap Monster]
The curtain falls and I’m out of breath
I get mixed feelings as I breathe out
Did I make any mistakes today
How did the audience seem
I’m happy with who I’ve become
That I can make someone scream with joy
Still excited from the performance

[Verse 2: Suga]
I stand on the empty stage while holding onto an aftertaste that will not linger for long
While standing on this empty stage, I become afraid of this unpleasant emptiness
Within my suffocating feelings
On top of my life’s line
Without a reason, I forcibly act that I am fine
This isn’t the first time, I better get used to it
I try to hide it, but I can’t
When the heat of the show cools down
I leave the empty seats behind

[Verse 3: J-hope]
Trying to comfort myself
I tell myself the world can’t be perfect
I start to let myself go
The thundering applause, I can’t own it forever
I tell myself, so shameless
Raise your voice higher
Even if the attention isn’t forever, I’ll keep singing
As today’s me, I want eternity
Forever, I want to be young

[Chorus: V]
Forever we are young

[Jungkook]
Under the flower petals raining down
I run, so lost in this maze

Forever we are young

Even when I fall and hurt myself
I endlessly run toward my dream

Forever ever ever ever

Forever we are young
Even when I fall and hurt myself
I keep running toward my dream

I’m so into your Converse Highs
I can’t help it
I’m so into your Converse Highs
I like it so much

[Verse 1: RM]
If I had only one day
I will go see the person who created Converse Highs
Then I’ll tell that person, you saved the world
You made that girl born again
F your Chanel F your Alexander Mcqueen
F your Raf Simons, just come here and check it
You can buy two pairs with just 100 dollars, you know what I want
White t-shirt, jeans and red Converse Highs, that’s it

[Verse 2: J-Hope]
Alright, red orange yellow green blue violet indigo
The rainbow on your feet is shot like Rambo
It aims at me, bang bang, shout out wow wow
Together with your body makes me go hukhuk
Big taxi, big cycle, big subway
No thanks, I wanna ride the big bus
Rather than the stars in the sky, I wanna see the stars on your shoes
Haha, without Namjoon knowing

You pass by and become connected
You enter in and become love

When you look all flashy with your black stockings
And your high heels, that’s just a lie
But you look better with Jordan numbers
Ha don’t you know? Converse kill your charms
Anyway, when you meet me, don’t wear Converses
It’s too hard to take them off of you

You pass by and become connected

You shine in this pitch darkness that is the butterfly effect
Your light touches, I forget the reality at once

I bloomed for you, but I’m still getting thirsty
It’s too late, too late, I can’t live without you
Though my branch runs dry, I reach for you with all my strength

No matter how far I reach for you
It is just an empty dream dream dream
No matter how crazy I run
I remain on the same place place place
Just burn me! Yes, push me out!
This is crazy-fool’s love running

Let me run more
Please let me run more
Even though my feet are full of scars
I smile whenever I see you

Let’s run run run again! I can’t stop running
Let’s run run run again! I can’t help running
Only thing I can do is run
Only thing I can do is love you

Don’t tell me bye bye
(Run)
You make me cry cry
(Run)
Love is a lie lie
Don’t tell me, don’t tell me
Don’t tell me bye bye

[Verse 3: J-Hope]
Everyone says it’s over, but I can’t stop
Is this sweat or tear, I can’t really tell oh
My love stripped bare, the stormy winds
They make me run again, my heart beats again

[Pre-Chorus: Jin]
Make me run
Make me run more
Let my feet rip apart with wounds
At least I can I smile when I see you

[Chorus]
I run, run, run
I can’t stop
Run, run, run again
I can’t help it
This is all I can do anyway
All I know is how to love you

Run, run, run again
It’s okay to fall
Run, run. Run, again
It’s okay to get hurt
I’m alright, even if I can’t have you
Pitiful destiny, point your finger at me

[Bridge: V, Jungkook, Jin]
Memories crumble like dried flower petals
At the tip of my fingers, under my feet
Right behind your back
I’m chasing butterflies, so lost in dreams
I follow your traces
Show me the way, please stop me
Let me breathe

[Chorus]
I run, run, run
I can’t stop
Run, run, run again
I can’t help it
This is all I can do anyway
All I know is how to love you

Run, run, run again
It’s okay to fall
Run, run. Run, again
It’s okay to get hurt
I’m alright, even if I can’t have you
Pitiful destiny, point your finger at me

(Run)
Don’t tell me bye bye
(Run)
You make me cry cry
(Run)
Love is a lie lie
Don’t tell me, don’t tell me
Don’t tell me bye bye

[Verse 1: Jungkook]
Don’t think of anything
Don’t say anything, not even a word
Just give me a smile

[V]
I still can’t believe it
All of this seems like a dream
Don’t try to disappear

[Pre-Chorus: Jungkook]
Is it true Is it true
You You
You’re so beautiful, that I’m scared

[Jimin]
Untrue Untrue
You You You

[Refrain: Jungkook]
Will you stay by my side
Will you promise me
If I let go of your hand, you’ll fly away and break
I’m scared scared scared of that

[Jimin]
Will you stop time
If this moment passes
As though it hadn’t happened
I’m scared scared scared I’ll lose you

[Chorus: Jungkook]
Butterfly like a Butterfly
Just like a Butterfly bu butterfly

[V]
Butterfly like a butterfly
Just like a Butterfly bu butterfly

[Verse 2: Suga]
You’re just like a Butterfly
From afar, I steal glances; if we touch hands, will I lose you?
You shine in this pitch darkness that is the butterfly effect
Your light touches, I forget the reality at once

[Verse 3: J-Hope]
It’s like a wind that gently strokes me
It’s like a dust that gently drifts along
You’re there but for some reason, I can’t reach you, stop
You, who’s like a dream is a butterfly high to me

[Pre-Chorus: Jin]
Untrue Untrue
You You You

[Refrain: Jungkook]
Will you stay by my side
Will you promise me
If I let go of your hand, you’ll fly away and break

Will you stop time
If this moment passes
As though it hadn’t happened
I’m scared scared scared I’ll lose you

[Bridge: Rap Monster]
The small pieces guttered down darkly
From my heart, a barren noise
I don’t know if this is reality or a dream
My Kafka on the seaside
Don’t go to those woods over there
My heart is still shattering on you
(I just wanted to vaporize like this)
My love that is forever
It’s all FREE for you baby

[Refrain: Jungkook]
Will you stay by my side
Will you promise me
If I let go of your hand, you’ll fly away and break
I’m scared scared scared of that

Fall Fall Fall, scattering apart
Fall Fall Fall, falling

[Verse 1: Suga]
Because of you, I’m becoming ruined
I wanna stop, I don’t want you anymore
I can’t do it, this sucks
Please don’t give me any excuses

[Verse 2: J-Hope]
You can’t do this to me
All of the things you said are like a mask
It hides the truth and rips me apart
It pierces me, I’m going crazy, I hate this
Take it all away, I hate you

[Verse 3: V, RM, Suga]
But you’re my everything (You’re my)
Everything (You’re my)
Everything (You’re my)
Please go away huh

I’m sorry (I hate you)
I love you (I hate you)
Forgive me

[Chorus: Jimin, Jungkook, RM, Jungkook & RM]
I need you girl
Why am I in love alone, why am I hurting alone
I need you girl
Why do I keep needing you when I know I’ll get hurt?

I need you girl, you’re beautiful
I need you girl, you’re so cold
I need you girl I need you girl
I need you girl I need you girl

[Verse 4: RM, V]
It goes round & round, why do I keep coming back
I go down & down, at this point, I’m just a fool
Whatever I do, I can’t help it
It’s definitely my heart, my feelings but why don’t they listen to me
I’m just talking to myself again, talking to myself again
I’m just talking to myself again, talking to myself again
You’re not saying anything, please, I’ll treat you well
But the sky is blue, the sky is blue

[Verse 5: Jin]
The sky is blue and the sun is shining
So my tears are even more noticeable
Why is it you? Why did it have to be you?
Why can’t I leave you?

[Chorus: Jungkook, Jimin, RM, Jungkook & RM]
I need you girl
Why am I in love alone, why am I hurting alone
I need you girl
Why do I keep needing you when I know I’ll get hurt?

I need you girl, you’re beautiful
I need you girl, you’re so cold
I need you girl I need you girl
I need you girl I need you girl

[Bridge: Jin, V, Jungkook, Jimin]
Girl, just tell me you wanna break up
Girl, just tell me it wasn’t love
I have no courage to say that
Give me my last gift
So I can’t ever go back to you

[Chorus: Jimin, Jungkook, RM, Jungkook & RM]
I need you girl
Why am I in love alone, why am I hurting alone
I need you girl
Why do I keep needing you when I know I’ll get hurt?

I need you girl, you’re beautiful
I need you girl, you’re so cold
I need you girl I need you girl
I need you girl I need you girl

98,hold-me-tight,"

[Verse 1: RM]
I empty my drink but it gets filled with loneliness
I should’ve just given in, why did I argue all the time?
Even the trash bag thrown away on the street makes a lonely sound in the wind
All I did was color you in my white, blank paper
But then I realized, it already became a finished picture
You and I are like cell phones, when we’re apart you know we’ll be broken
Only your scent completes me
Hurry and hug me

[Pre-Chorus: Suga, Jungkook]
I can only see you
I can only see you alone
Look, I’m fair with everyone else but you
Now I can’t live a day without you, please

[Chorus: V, Jimin]
Hold me tight, hug me
Can you trust me? Can you trust me? Can you trust me?
Pull me in tight
Hold me tight, hug me
Can you trust me? Can you trust me?
Please, please, please pull me in and hug me

[Post-Chorus: Jungkook, Jin, Jimin]
You still shine
You’re still like a scented flower
Now trust me, hold me once again
So I can feel you, hold me

Without you, I can’t breathe
I’m nothing without you
Open my closed heart, drench my heart
So I can feel you, hold me

[Verse 2: J-Hope]
Your arms, your warmth, your heart
I want to see it all, I beg you
This moment, even the warm flower scented wind
Even the sky without a single cloud
Everything feels cold and I’m even scared of the clear sky
If you’re not here, I’m just a corpse, so how can I breathe?
It hurts, I’m always cry cry cry
I’m going crazy, exhausted without you
I think of you without stopping
I hate it all, I hate every single day
It makes me cry, ring ding dong
If there’s a chance, I’ll catch you
I’m running, it’s starting, count down
I’m ready to be cut by your rose-like embrace, as I hold you again

[Pre-Chorus: Suga, Jimin]
I can only see you
I can only see you alone
Look, I’m fair with everyone else but you
Now I can’t live a day without you, please

[Chorus: Jungkook, Jin]
Hold me tight, hug me
Can you trust me? Can you trust me? Can you trust me?
Pull me in tight
Hold me tight, hug me
Can you trust me? Can you trust me?
Please, please, please pull me in and hug me

[Bridge: Suga]
Your cold face tells me everything rather than words
I can see a break up rising over me like a high tide
I know it will soon be our last but I can’t let you go
Don’t talk, don’t leave, just quietly hold me girl

[Chorus: Jimin, V]
Hold me tight, hug me
Trust me, trust me, trust me
Hold me tight, hug me
Can you trust me? Can you trust me?
Please, please, please pull me in and hug me

[Post-Chorus: Jungkook, Jimin]
You still shine
You’re still like a scented flower
Now trust me, hold me once again
So I can feel you, hold me

It’s too late, too late
I can’t live without you
Even if I‘m drying out, I try harder to reach you

[Verse 1: Suga]
But it’s no use, it’s a dream to be broken
I run and run, but I’m not getting anywhere
Just burn me out, yes
Keep pushing me away
This is a fool, crazy in love, chasing in circles

Make me run
Make me run more
Let my feet rip apart with wounds
At least I can I smile when I see you

[Verse 1: Rap Monster]
I don’t know what to say
Even if I die, I can’t tell
Even if you give me a hundred thousand dollars to live somewhere else
Ah, no thanks
Ilsan is where I want to be buried even after I die
It’s the city of the flower, city of Mon
La Festa and the Western Dom that are like home
The Hugok Academy that raised me during my young years, uh
The most harmonious place in the world, uh
Nature and the city’s building and flowers, uh
Me, who likes the Ilsan Lake Park more than the Han River
Will hug you much more warmly, even though we’re small
When I feel like I’m forgetting myself
In that place, I find my old self
(I) remember everything, even your smell
You’re my summer autumn
Winter and every spring

Even if my footsteps go to the mountains
It always goes to the summit of Mt. Mudeung, every day
My life is hot, the heat of the south
There’s no such thing as giving up on the law of this fierce heat
I put on a KIA and I turn on the engine
Bounce like crazy
With just one dance I raise my big dream of being a singer
Now in front of reality (I do) music and I jump on stage
Everyone saw, right? I put in passion
I’m Gwangju’s hoshigi, the country’s 8 provinces gear up
If you want to see me then gather at 7
Everyone dial it, 062 - 518

I was born in Daegu, I was brought up in Daegu
It’s a bit difficult to get a blood transfusion
My blue blood inside my body
This bastard in every album
Talks about Daegu
And doesn’t seem to get bored of it
You can think like that but
I’m a D-boy, that’s right I’m a D-boy
Honestly speaking, in Daegu
There’s nothing much to boast about
My birth is in itself, Daegu’s pride
Right? Ah alright
There’s nothing to boast
But I can’t help but be proud, right?
Ayo, I’m the most successful guy born in Daegu
You will hear this kind of thing, listen well now
I’m Daegu’s pride, a new generation, a new wind
Daegu’s past, present, and future

Even if our youth rots in the studio
Thanks to that, we're closer to success

Given up on 3? Given up on 5??
I like the number 6, how about giving up on 6?
The media and adults say we don’t have willpower, condemning us like stocks
Why are they killing us before we can even try, enemy enemy enemy
Why are you hanging your head and accepting it already? energy energy energy
Don’t ever give up, you know you not lonely
Our dawn is prettier than the day
So can I get a little bit of hope yeah
Wake your sleeping youth, go

I want to breathe, I hate this night
I want to wake up, I hate this dream
I’m trapped inside of myself and I’m dead
Don’t wanna be lonely
Just wanna be yours

Why is it so dark where you’re not here
It’s dangerous how wrecked I am
Save me because I can’t get a grip on myself

Listen to my heartbeat
It calls you whenever it wants to
Because within this pitch black darkness
You are shining so brightly

Give me your hand
Save me save me
I need your love before
I fall, fall
Give me your hand save me save me
I need your love before I fall, fall

Give me your hand save me save me
Give me your hand save me save me

Save me, save me

Today the moon shines brighter on the blank spot in my memories
It swallowed me, this lunatic, please save me tonight
(Please save me tonight, please save me tonight)
Within this childish madness you will save me tonight

I knew that your salvation
Is a part of my life and the only helping hand that will embrace my pain
The best of me, you’re the only thing I have
Please raise your voice so that I can laugh again
Play on

Listen to my heartbeat, it calls you whenever it wants to
Because within this pitch black darkness, you are shining so brightly

Give me your hand save me save me
I need your love before I fall, fall
Give me your hand save me save me
I need your love before I fall, fall

Give me your hand save me save me
Give me your hand save me save me

Thank you for letting me be me
For helping me fly
For giving me wings
For straightening me out
For waking me from being suffocated
For waking me from a dream which was all I was living in
When I think of you the sun comes out
So I gave my sadness to the dog
(Thank you. For being ‘us’)

Give me your hand save me save me
I need your love before I fall, fall
Give me your hand save me save me
I need your love before I fall, fall

I will go see the person who created Converse Highs
Then I’ll tell that person, you saved the world
You made that girl born again
F your Chanel F your Alexander Mcqueen
F your Raf Simons, just come here and check it
You can buy two pairs with just 100 dollars, you know what I want
White t-shirt, jeans and red Converse Highs, that’s it

Alright, red orange yellow green blue violet indigo
The rainbow on your feet is shot like Rambo

No thanks, I wanna ride the big bus
Rather than the stars in the sky, I wanna see the stars on your shoes

Anyway, when you meet me, don’t wear Converses
It’s too hard to take them off of you

105,moving-on,"

[Verse 1: RM]
Ayo SUGA
I remember how we came here three years ago
When you and I used to fight all the time
The wallpaper, bathroom and veranda were all blue
Back then I thought this was a big place
But my ambition grew too big
That big house became too small now
When the nine trainees shared a 17-pyung house
Seems like it was just yesterday, we grew up a lot
Good things were always other people’s things
We were always hoarse from an uncertain future and worries
Seeing all the senior artists at the end of the year awards
Let’s not forget those things but put them away
This place smells like us
Let’s not forget this scent, wherever we are
We cried a lot and laughed a lot but it was so beautiful
Nonhyeon-dong, 3rd floor, thank you

[Chorus: V]
Let’s move
Goodbye to this place, that we grew attached to
Let’s move
Now to a higher place
While taking the last box out of the empty room
I looked back for a moment
Times we cried and laughed
Goodbye now

[Verse 2: J-Hope]
Three years felt so short but so long
A lot of things happened, there were many memories
I remember now that we’re about to leave
Traces of being used like bank accounts and credit cards
As much as the place was small, we were bound together tighter
Fight right here, hitting each other sometimes
Maybe that’s why but we have good feelings and bad feelings of love too
Even the dust will be cleared now
There’s more stuff than the beginning, I have more than when I started too
Now let’s take our pride and go toward a bigger world with a bigger dream
A new start, a new beginning
Excited to see how it will become
Move the boxes, hold your place, wipe the dust
After you’re done, let’s get a bowl of black bean noodles, that’s right

[Chorus: Jin]
Let’s move
Goodbye to this place, that we grew attached to
Let’s move
Now to a higher place
While taking the last box out of the empty room
I looked back for a moment
Times we cried and laughed
Goodbye now

[Verse 3: Suga]
Ever since I was born
I counted the days for my first move
I remember, why I had to move
The machine in my mom’s heart and the big scar
In winter of 2010 at Daegu
The childish me used to measure the size of the world
The reason why we moved into a business
Was because of all the bad things people said, saying we follow money
So moving left many things with me
Whether I liked it or not, it changed a lot in my life
My life was about paying rent, I know
I lived with my pride put into the down payment
So I’m gonna move again
I’m gonna have a dream, a level higher than being an idol
When will I stop having to move again?
I hope it comes quickly

[Chorus: Jimin]
Let’s move
Goodbye to this place, that we grew attached to
Let’s move
Now to a higher place
While taking the last box out of the empty room
I looked back for a moment
Times we cried and laughed
Goodbye now

[Chorus: Jungkook]
Let’s move
Goodbye to this place, that we grew attached to
Let’s move
Now to a higher place
While taking the last box out of the empty room
I looked back for a moment
Times we cried and laughed
Goodbye now

[Outro: RM]
Everyone’s afraid of changes
Staying, moving on, staying, moving on
We keep repeating the same things again and again
I guess that’s life, I’m afraid
Old or new, new or old, that isn’t really important
What’s important is, that we still breathe and live in the same place
So let’s move on

[Verse 1: Jungkook]
Don’t think of anything
Don’t say anything, not even a word
Just give me a smile

[V]
I still can’t believe it
All of this seems like a dream
Don’t try to disappear

[Pre-Chorus: Jungkook]
Is it true Is it true
You You
You’re so beautiful, that I’m scared

[Jimin]
Untrue Untrue
You You You

[Refrain: Jungkook]
Will you stay by my side
Will you promise me
If I let go of your hand, you’ll fly away and break
I’m scared scared scared of that

[Jimin]
Will you stop time
If this moment passes
As though it hadn’t happened
I’m scared scared scared I’ll lose you

[Chorus: Jungkook]
Butterfly like a Butterfly
Just like a Butterfly bu butterfly

[V]
Butterfly like a butterfly
Just like a Butterfly bu butterfly

[Verse 2: Suga]
You’re just like a Butterfly
From afar, I steal glances; if we touch hands, will I lose you?
You shine in this pitch darkness that is the butterfly effect
Your light touches, I forget the reality at once

[Verse 3: J-Hope]
It’s like a wind that gently strokes me
It’s like a dust that gently drifts along
You’re there but for some reason, I can’t reach you, stop
You, who’s like a dream is a butterfly high to me

[Pre-Chorus: Jin]
Untrue Untrue
You You You

[Refrain: Jungkook]
Will you stay by my side
Will you promise me
If I let go of your hand, you’ll fly away and break
I’m scared scared scared of that

[V]
Will you stop time
If this moment passes
As though it hadn’t happened
I’m scared scared scared I’ll lose you

[Bridge: Rap Monster]
The small pieces guttered down darkly
From my heart, a barren noise
I don’t know if this is reality or a dream
My Kafka on the seaside
Don’t go to those woods over there
My heart is still shattering on you
(I just wanted to vaporize like this)
My love that is forever
It’s all FREE for you baby

[Refrain: Jungkook]
Will you stay by my side
Will you promise me
If I let go of your hand, you’ll fly away and break
I’m scared scared scared of that

Fall Fall Fall, falling

[Verse 1: Suga]
Because of you, I’m becoming ruined
I wanna stop, I don’t want you anymore
I can’t do it, this sucks
Please don’t give me any excuses

[Verse 2: J-Hope]
You can’t do this to me
All of the things you said are like a mask
It hides the truth and rips me apart
It pierces me, I’m going crazy, I hate this
Take it all away, I hate you

[Verse 3: V, RM, Suga]
But you’re my everything (You’re my)
Everything (You’re my)
Everything (You’re my)
Please go away huh

I’m sorry (I hate you)
I love you (I hate you)
Forgive me

[Chorus: Jimin, Jungkook, RM, Jungkook & RM]
I need you girl
Why am I in love alone, why am I hurting alone
I need you girl
Why do I keep needing you when I know I’ll get hurt?

I need you girl, you’re beautiful
I need you girl, you’re so cold
I need you girl I need you girl
I need you girl I need you girl

[Verse 4: RM, V]
It goes round & round, why do I keep coming back
I go down & down, at this point, I’m just a fool
Whatever I do, I can’t help it
It’s definitely my heart, my feelings but why don’t they listen to me
I’m just talking to myself again, talking to myself again
I’m just talking to myself again, talking to myself again
You’re not saying anything, please, I’ll treat you well
But the sky is blue, the sky is blue

[Verse 5: Jin]
The sky is blue and the sun is shining
So my tears are even more noticeable
Why is it you? Why did it have to be you?
Why can’t I leave you?

I need you girl
Why am I in love alone, why am I hurting alone

Give me my last gift

You’re my sun, one and only in this world
I bloom for you, but you make me thirsty
It’s too late, too late
I can’t live without you
Even if I‘m drying out, I try harder to reach you

[Verse 1: Suga]
But it’s no use, it’s a dream to be broken
I run and run, but I’m not getting anywhere
Just burn me out, yes
Keep pushing me away
This is a fool, crazy in love, chasing in circles

Let my feet rip apart with wounds
At least I can I smile when I see you

At the tip of my fingers, under my feet
Right behind your back
I’m chasing butterflies, so lost in dreams
I follow your traces
Show me the way, please stop me
Let me breathe

Even if I die, I can’t tell
Even if you give me a hundred thousand dollars to live somewhere else
Ah, no thanks
Ilsan is where I want to be buried even after I die
It’s the city of the flower, city of Mon
La Festa and the Western Dom that are like home
The Hugok Academy that raised me during my young years, uh
The most harmonious place in the world, uh
Nature and the city’s building and flowers, uh
Me, who likes the Ilsan Lake Park more than the Han River
Will hug you much more warmly, even though we’re small
When I feel like I’m forgetting myself
In that place, I find my old self
(I) remember everything, even your smell
You’re my summer autumn
Winter and every spring

There’s no such thing as giving up on the law of this fierce heat
I put on a KIA and I turn on the engine
Bounce like crazy
With just one dance I raise my big dream of being a singer
Now in front of reality (I do) music and I jump on stage
Everyone saw, right? I put in passion
I’m Gwangju’s hoshigi, the country’s 8 provinces gear up
If you want to see me then gather at 7
Everyone dial it, 062 - 518

I’m a D-boy, that’s right I’m a D-boy
Honestly speaking, in Daegu
There’s nothing much to boast about
My birth is in itself, Daegu’s pride
Right? Ah alright
There’s nothing to boast
But I can’t help but be proud, right?
Ayo, I’m the most successful guy born in Daegu
You will hear this kind of thing, listen well now
I’m Daegu’s pride, a new generation, a new wind
Daegu’s past, present, and future

Runch Randa and Rapmon
Are both part of me
The envy of the aspiring rappers my age
You guys only see what
You want to see anyway
You foolish and young’ins
With short educations like capri pants
When you rap about love and affection
I rap about big things
Those smack-cracker dolls who are filled
With inferiority complexes
Talk smack about my sunglasses, my hairstyle, my name
It’s sad comedy of losers in reality
My rap smothers you
Making you suffocate
Head-scratching kids who say they hate the busy world of K-Pop
Pretending to be someone they’re not
I know you suck suck
Damn fan, the public, manias
Yeah I’m makin’ em mine
Big Hit and Bangtan Boys
Yeah I’m makin’ em shine
Hooligans who will bring the value of our name
I’ve never wanted a hole-in-one
Yeah bitch I wanna be the one
Not number one but the only one
Swag

[Chorus: Jungkook, Jimin, Jin, V, RM]
I don’t know you and you don’t know me
So please shut up
Don’t worry about me, I’m better than you
And will continue to be so
Where are all the friends who looked
Down on my since before? We on
This isn’t a joke
I’ll show you, I promise ya, we on
(Gimme dat, real fact)
I’ll show you, I promise ya, we on
(Gimme dat, real fact)
I’ll show you, I promise ya, we on

[Hook: RM]
Whatever they say
I’m here for my music
Here for my music
H-here for my music
Whatever my haters
Say I’m real for my music
Real for my music
R-real for my music

[Verse 2: Suga]
Oh oh my haters, talk more smack about me
Keyboard warriors, make some more effort
Yes, look down on me like that
It’s my hobby
To prove you wrong
Uh my skills become a controversy
It’s too early to draw a conclusion
I’m killa, Jack the Ripper
I’ll pierce you with my sharp tongue
I’m illa, even if I’m lazy
I’m busier than you, hit home?
The haters who looked down on me before my debut
You were filled with hip-hop
Pride but now you’re beneath me
Look carefully, I’m in the majors
Jealous? Hey chaser
I think it’s too much
For you to follow
Just stay there
These lyrics I wrote myself is a hand-lib
I graduated from being a trainee, celebrate
I’m a rap blackbelt
You’re just a green belt
There’s no growth, hey guys
Feel more inferior

[Chorus: Jungkook. Jimin, V, Jin, RM]
I don’t know you and you don’t know me
So please shut up
Don’t worry about me, I’m better than you
And will continue to be so
Where are all the friends who looked
Down on my since before? We on
This isn’t a joke
I’ll show you, I promise ya, we on
(Gimme dat, real fact)
I’ll show you, I promise ya, we on
(Gimme dat, real fact)
I’ll show you, I promise ya, we on

[Verse 3: J-Hope]
2 Cool 4 Skool
Promotions received standing ovations
This is for all the
Kids who smirked at us
“Congratulations”, yeah right
You’re just saying that
For connections
If so, your senses have rot, cut them out
Uh now our level has changed
He knows and she knows
Everyone’s number one interest
It’s too early to be awed
Look out for my future
I’ll go toward the path of my
Success as much as you looked down on me

[Chorus: Jungkook. Jimin, V, Jin, RM]
I don’t know you and you don’t know me
So please shut up
Don’t worry about me, I’m better than you
And will continue to be so
Where are all the friends who looked
Down on my since before? We on
This isn’t a joke
I’ll show you, I promise ya, we on
(Gimme dat, real fact)
I’ll show you, I promise ya, we on
(Gimme dat, real fact)
I’ll show you, I promise ya, we on

[Hook: RM]
Whatever they say
I’m here for my music
Here for my music
H-here for my music
Whatever my haters
Say I’m real for my music
Real for my music
R-real for my music

116,if-i-ruled-the-world,"

[Intro: V & Jimin, Jungkook]
If I ruled the world I’d do it all
(Westside, westside, westside)
If I ruled the world I’d do it all
(Westside, westside, westside)

[Verse 1: RM]
If I ruled the world I’d have it all
All guys probably feel the same
When it comes to pretty girls, There’s no racism
European, Asian, Caucasian girls
(I have ‘em)
Call Rick Owens, Ann Demeulemeester
Alexander Wang and Shane Oliver
I’ll make them make
The Kim Namjoon Collection forever
The color of the clothes would be black
Now I’m finally pleased
Music, turn it up
I’d pick my nose out of boredom
So I’ll make a song and
Make everyone on earth sing it
The title of the song would be “Ae gu ga”
I’ll be buried under pretty girls as I watch TV
All girls of the world would want me, ready to die
Boys, bring me alcohol
Or you can just disappear
Anyway, this is my kingdom

[Chorus: V, V & Jimin, Jungkook, Jin]
If I ruled the world
I’d do it all (I’d do it all)
I said 1 for the money, 2 for the money
If I ruled the world
I’d do it all (I’d do it all)
I said 1 for the money, 2 for the money

Everybody say he-o-e-oh-oh!
Everybody say he-o-e-oh-oh!
Everybody say hey, ho! Hey-hey-ho!
I know it’s ridiculous
But I’m singing this childish song

[Verse 2: Suga]
If I ruled the world, sometimes, I dream
If I ruled the world, first I’ll hire a real estate agent
And buy a house to live in with my family
Yes, next I’ll awaken my savings
And buy a four-wheel drive, put in some gas
Even if it’s too much
I’ll get it with zero-interest discount
Stocks and gambling
I don’t wanna do things like that
I rule the world so why would I dream small?
Don’t ask me that because
I still want to do music with my BTS family
I will become the Kim Jung-Un of the hip-hop world
And put a ban on everything but our music
I know it’s an unreasonable dream but it’s my dream
Don’t make fun of me

[Chorus: V, V & Jimin, Jungkook, Jin]
If I ruled the world
I’d do it all (I’d do it all)
I said 1 for the money, 2 for the money
If I ruled the world
I’d do it all (I’d do it all)
I said 1 for the money, 2 for the money

Everybody say he-o-e-oh-oh!
Everybody say he-o-e-oh-oh!
Everybody say hey, ho! Hey-hey-ho!
I know it’s ridiculous
But I’m singing this childish song

[Verse 3: J-Hope]
Oh girl, where? Oh god, here!
All the girls of the world are in hope world, lined up
Even if I lightly spend all the money I want
Money is put into the goalpost called my wallet
I’ll fearlessly walk around the stage
Even if I don’t run, my mileage would still build up
I will soon gift myself with these dreams
I’ll shout with the name of BTS
If I ruled the world

[Chorus: V, V & Jimin, Jungkook, Jin]
If I ruled the world
I’d do it all (I’d do it all)
I said 1 for the money, 2 for the money
If I ruled the world
I’d do it all (I’d do it all)
I said 1 for the money, 2 for the money

Everybody say he-o-e-oh-oh!
Everybody say he-o-e-oh-oh!
Everybody say hey, ho! Hey-hey-ho!

[Outro: Jin, Jimin, V, Jungkook]
I know it’s ridiculous
But I’m singing this childish song

117,coffee,"

[Chorus: Jungkook]
Baby baby, you’re a caramel macchiato
Your scent is still sweet on my lips
Baby baby tonight
Yeah

[Verse 1: RM]
Girl, I debuted, that’s enough right?
I made a bet with the world on how much I’d succeed
My half-moon eye smile that I only showed you
I’m doing it again these days
My fans are curious
Oh and I don’t drink macchiatos
You know that I started drinking americanos because of you
When we dated, I wondered what kind of taste this was
But this cold and bitter aftertaste
Makes sense now that you’re not here girl
If I’m gonna get used to everything like this
I would choose the full-of-regrets, playing with fire
Our heartless promises
Countless mistakes and other wrongs
Our unspeakable and small wounds
The glass filled with memories is more bitter as I drink it
But I think I know why I keep drinking it
Why am I getting so sad that everyone lives this way?
Oh oh oh

[Chorus: Jungkook, V]
Baby baby, you’re a caramel macchiato
Your scent is still sweet on my lips
Baby baby tonight
Yeah yeah yeah

Baby baby, you were warmer than the scent of a cafe latte
Do you remember that feeling?
Baby baby tonight
Yeah

[Verse 2: Suga]
Baby tonight, have a good night
Our first text and phone call that
Was filled with awkward moments
Our highly anticipated first date
Why did I bite my nails? Why was I so nervous?
As time went by, we naturally developed into lovers
With those kinds of words
We checked each other’s feelings
Our first date was sweet like a caramel macchiato
Wherever we went, we wanted to go together
But as time went by
Those feelings went down like dripping down espresso
Uh, my insides ache for no reason, uh we used to be so good
Breaking up was like a bitter americano
My memories still go to that cafe

[Chorus: Jungkook, Jin]
Baby baby, you’re a caramel macchiato
Your scent is still sweet on my lips
Baby baby tonight
Yeah

Baby baby, you were warmer than the scent of a cafe latte
Do you remember that feeling?
Baby baby tonight

[Bridge: J-Hope]
1,2,3,4
The days when I used to be
Intoxicated with your scent all day
I remember we chose to break up
After promising our futures together
As I drink this minty coffee that you
Used to like, I think of you, rewind
A lot of time passed and these days
I sometimes miss you, I wonder why?

[Chorus: Jungkook, Jimin]
Baby baby, you’re a caramel macchiato
Your scent is still sweet on my lips
Baby baby tonight

Baby baby, you were warmer than the scent of a cafe latte
Do you remember that feeling?
Baby baby tonight

118,run,"

[Verse 1: Rap Monster]
You’re my sun, one and only in this world
I bloom for you, but you make me thirsty
It’s too late, too late
I can’t live without you
Even if I‘m drying out, I try harder to reach you

[Verse 1: Suga]
But it’s no use, it’s a dream to be broken
I run and run, but I’m not getting anywhere
Just burn me out, yes
Keep pushing me away
This is a fool, crazy in love, chasing in circles

[Pre-Chorus: V]
Make me run
Make me run more
Let my feet rip apart with wounds
At least I can I smile when I see you

[Chorus]
I run, run, run
I can’t stop
Run, run, run again
I can’t help it
This is all I can do anyway
All I know is how to love you

Run, run, run again
It’s okay to fall
Run, run. Run, again
It’s okay to get hurt
I’m alright, even if I can’t have you
Pitiful destiny, point your finger at me

(Run)
Don’t tell me bye bye
(Run)
You make me cry cry
(Run)
Love is a lie lie
Don’t tell me, don’t tell me
Don’t tell me bye bye

[Verse 3: J-Hope]
Everyone says it’s over, but I can’t stop
Is this sweat or tear, I can’t really tell oh
My love stripped bare, the stormy winds
They make me run again, my heart beats again

[Pre-Chorus: Jin]
Make me run
Make me run more
Let my feet rip apart with wounds
At least I can I smile when I see you

[Chorus]
I run, run, run
I can’t stop
Run, run, run again
I can’t help it
This is all I can do anyway
All I know is how to love you

Run, run, run again
It’s okay to fall
Run, run. Run, again
It’s okay to get hurt
I’m alright, even if I can’t have you
Pitiful destiny, point your finger at me

[Bridge: V, Jungkook, Jin]
Memories crumble like dried flower petals
At the tip of my fingers, under my feet
Right behind your back
I’m chasing butterflies, so lost in dreams
I follow your traces
Show me the way, please stop me
Let me breathe

[Chorus]
I run, run, run
I can’t stop
Run, run, run again
I can’t help it
This is all I can do anyway
All I know is how to love you

Run, run, run again
It’s okay to fall
Run, run. Run, again
It’s okay to get hurt
I’m alright, even if I can’t have you
Pitiful destiny, point your finger at me

(Run)
Don’t tell me bye bye
(Run)
You make me cry cry
(Run)
Love is a lie lie
Don’t tell me, don’t tell me
Don’t tell me bye bye

[Verse 1: Jungkook]
Don’t think of anything
Don’t say anything, not even a word
Just give me a smile

[V]
I still can’t believe it
All of this seems like a dream
Don’t try to disappear

[Pre-Chorus: Jungkook]
Is it true Is it true
You You
You’re so beautiful, that I’m scared

[Jimin]
Untrue Untrue
You You You

[Refrain: Jungkook]
Will you stay by my side
Will you promise me
If I let go of your hand, you’ll fly away and break
I’m scared scared scared of that

[Jimin]
Will you stop time
If this moment passes
As though it hadn’t happened
I’m scared scared scared I’ll lose you

[Chorus: Jungkook]
Butterfly like a Butterfly
Just like a Butterfly bu butterfly

[V]
Butterfly like a butterfly
Just like a Butterfly bu butterfly

[Verse 2: Suga]
You’re just like a Butterfly
From afar, I steal glances; if we touch hands, will I lose you?
You shine in this pitch darkness that is the butterfly effect
Your light touches, I forget the reality at once

[Verse 3: J-Hope]
It’s like a wind that gently strokes me
It’s like a dust that gently drifts along
You’re there but for some reason, I can’t reach you, stop
You, who’s like a dream is a butterfly high to me

[Pre-Chorus: Jin]
Untrue Untrue
You You You

[Refrain: Jungkook]
Will you stay by my side
Will you promise me
If I let go of your hand, you’ll fly away and break
I’m scared scared scared of that

[V]
Will you stop time
If this moment passes
As though it hadn’t happened
I’m scared scared scared I’ll lose you

[Bridge: Rap Monster]
The small pieces guttered down darkly
From my heart, a barren noise
I don’t know if this is reality or a dream
My Kafka on the seaside
Don’t go to those woods over there
My heart is still shattering on you
(I just wanted to vaporize like this)
My love that is forever
It’s all FREE for you baby

[Refrain: Jungkook]
Will you stay by my side
Will you promise me
If I let go of your hand, you’ll fly away and break
I’m scared scared scared of that

[V]
Will you stop time
If this moment passes
As though it hadn’t happened
I’m scared scared scared I’ll lose you

Butterfly like a Butterfly
Just like a Butterfly bu butterfly

Butterfly like a butterfly
Just like a Butterfly bu butterfly

I ran for a long time
I ran again for a long time
Yeah I’ll be ridin' and I’ll be dyin’
In ma city

[Verse 1: Rap Monster]
I don’t know what to say
Even if I die, I can’t tell
Even if you give me a hundred thousand dollars to live somewhere else
Ah, no thanks
Ilsan is where I want to be buried even after I die
It’s the city of the flower, city of Mon
La Festa and the Western Dom that are like home
The Hugok Academy that raised me during my young years, uh
The most harmonious place in the world, uh
Nature and the city’s building and flowers, uh
Me, who likes the Ilsan Lake Park more than the Han River
Will hug you much more warmly, even though we’re small
When I feel like I’m forgetting myself
In that place, I find my old self
(I) remember everything, even your smell
You’re my summer autumn
Winter and every spring

[Pre-Chorus: Jimin, V, Jin]
The Busan beach there
Say la la la la la
Under the blue sky, this skyline
Say la la la la la
Ahjaedeul, put your hands up
Ahjimae too, wave your hands

[Verse 2: J-Hope]
I’m a South Jeollado, Gwangju's baby
Even if my footsteps go to the mountains
It always goes to the summit of Mt. Mudeung, every day
My life is hot, the heat of the south
There’s no such thing as giving up on the law of this fierce heat
I put on a KIA and I turn on the engine
Bounce like crazy
With just one dance I raise my big dream of being a singer
Now in front of reality (I do) music and I jump on stage
Everyone saw, right? I put in passion
I’m Gwangju’s hoshigi, the country’s 8 provinces gear up
If you want to see me then gather at 7
Everyone dial it, 062 - 518

[Pre-Chorus: Jimin, V, Jin]

The city that raised me
That’s right, baby baby
This is my city city
Welcome to ma city

[Verse 3: Suga]
I was born in Daegu, I was brought up in Daegu
It’s a bit difficult to get a blood transfusion
My blue blood inside my body
This bastard in every album
Talks about Daegu
And doesn’t seem to get bored of it
You can think like that but
I’m a D-boy, that’s right I’m a D-boy
Honestly speaking, in Daegu
There’s nothing much to boast about
My birth is in itself, Daegu’s pride
Right? Ah alright
There’s nothing to boast
But I can’t help but be proud, right?
Ayo, I’m the most successful guy born in Daegu
You will hear this kind of thing, listen well now
I’m Daegu’s pride, a new generation, a new wind
Daegu’s past, present, and future

[Chorus: Jin, Jungkook, Together]
Come to ma city
I hope that you’ll watch over me well
Know how to party
The city that raised me
That’s right, baby baby
This is my city city

121,intro-the-most-beautiful-moment-in-life,"

[Intro: Heavy breathing]

[Verse: Suga]
The rim looks farther away today
Sighs are building on top of the court
The boy is afraid of reality
But his heart is at peace only when he throws the ball
Throwing the ball by himself
What I’m shooting at the rim
Are my countless thoughts and worries
I pretend to know the world but my body is still not ready
Shoot, the court is my playground
With my movements, a small ball bounces next to my feet
The results are as low as the floor
But I just shout out loud to the world that everything’s gonna be alright
But the world gives me fear, then just stop
Thoughts fill my head and instead of the ball, I throw my future
Because of the other’s standard of success
My worries spread like cancer again, God damn it

Along with the thrown ball, laughter starts to spread
My breath rises to my chin, my dreams squirm about
The dribbles get faster, my heart gets happier
This moment feels like it’ll last forever but the sun is setting
When the night comes again, reality gets destroyed
When I snap out of it, I’m just a scared idiot again
I keep getting scared at the looming sense of reality
Others are running ahead but why am I still here?

Breathe or dream
Row the oars along with your heartbeat
If you are trapped in the other’s thin judgements
Then the sun will set on your life like a court

What am i doin’ with my life
This moment won’t ever come again
I’m asking myself again, am I happy right now?
The answer is already there, I’m happy

[Outro: Heavy breathing]

"
122,i-need-u,"

[Intro: Jungkook]
Fall Fall Fall, scattering apart
Fall Fall Fall, falling

[Verse 1: Suga]
Because of you, I’m becoming ruined
I wanna stop, I don’t want you anymore
I can’t do it, this sucks
Please don’t give me any excuses

[Verse 2: J-Hope]
You can’t do this to me
All of the things you said are like a mask
It hides the truth and rips me apart
It pierces me, I’m going crazy, I hate this
Take it all away, I hate you

[Verse 3: V, RM, Suga]
But you’re my everything (You’re my)
Everything (You’re my)
Everything (You’re my)
Please go away huh

I’m sorry (I hate you)
I love you (I hate you)
Forgive me

[Chorus: Jimin, Jungkook, RM, Jungkook & RM]
I need you girl
Why am I in love alone, why am I hurting alone
I need you girl
Why do I keep needing you when I know I’ll get hurt?

I need you girl, you’re beautiful
I need you girl, you’re so cold
I need you girl I need you girl
I need you girl I need you girl

[Verse 4: RM, V]
It goes round & round, why do I keep coming back
I go down & down, at this point, I’m just a fool
Whatever I do, I can’t help it
It’s definitely my heart, my feelings but why don’t they listen to me
I’m just talking to myself again, talking to myself again
I’m just talking to myself again, talking to myself again
You’re not saying anything, please, I’ll treat you well
But the sky is blue, the sky is blue

[Verse 5: Jin]
The sky is blue and the sun is shining
So my tears are even more noticeable
Why is it you? Why did it have to be you?
Why can’t I leave you?

[Chorus: Jungkook, Jimin, RM, Jungkook & RM]
I need you girl
Why am I in love alone, why am I hurting alone
I need you girl
Why do I keep needing you when I know I’ll get hurt?

I need you girl, you’re beautiful
I need you girl, you’re so cold
I need you girl I need you girl
I need you girl I need you girl

[Bridge: Jin, V, Jungkook, Jimin]
Girl, just tell me you wanna break up
Girl, just tell me it wasn’t love
I have no courage to say that
Give me my last gift
So I can’t ever go back to you

[Chorus: Jimin, Jungkook, RM, Jungkook & RM]
I need you girl
Why am I in love alone, why am I hurting alone
I need you girl
Why do I keep needing you when I know I’ll get hurt?

I need you girl, you’re beautiful
I need you girl, you’re so cold
I need you girl I need you girl
I need you girl I need you girl

123,hold-me-tight,"

[Verse 1: RM]
I empty my drink but it gets filled with loneliness
I should’ve just given in, why did I argue all the time?
Even the trash bag thrown away on the street makes a lonely sound in the wind
All I did was color you in my white, blank paper
But then I realized, it already became a finished picture
You and I are like cell phones, when we’re apart you know we’ll be broken
Only your scent completes me
Hurry and hug me

[Pre-Chorus: Suga, Jungkook]
I can only see you
I can only see you alone
Look, I’m fair with everyone else but you
Now I can’t live a day without you, please

[Chorus: V, Jimin]
Hold me tight, hug me
Can you trust me? Can you trust me? Can you trust me?
Pull me in tight
Hold me tight, hug me
Can you trust me? Can you trust me?
Please, please, please pull me in and hug me

[Post-Chorus: Jungkook, Jin, Jimin]
You still shine
You’re still like a scented flower
Now trust me, hold me once again
So I can feel you, hold me

Without you, I can’t breathe
I’m nothing without you
Open my closed heart, drench my heart
So I can feel you, hold me

[Verse 2: J-Hope]
Your arms, your warmth, your heart
I want to see it all, I beg you
This moment, even the warm flower scented wind
Even the sky without a single cloud
Everything feels cold and I’m even scared of the clear sky
If you’re not here, I’m just a corpse, so how can I breathe?
It hurts, I’m always cry cry cry
I’m going crazy, exhausted without you
I think of you without stopping
I hate it all, I hate every single day
It makes me cry, ring ding dong
If there’s a chance, I’ll catch you
I’m running, it’s starting, count down
I’m ready to be cut by your rose-like embrace, as I hold you again

[Pre-Chorus: Suga, Jimin]
I can only see you
I can only see you alone
Look, I’m fair with everyone else but you
Now I can’t live a day without you, please

[Chorus: Jungkook, Jin]
Hold me tight, hug me
Can you trust me? Can you trust me? Can you trust me?
Pull me in tight
Hold me tight, hug me
Can you trust me? Can you trust me?
Please, please, please pull me in and hug me

[Bridge: Suga]
Your cold face tells me everything rather than words
I can see a break up rising over me like a high tide
I know it will soon be our last but I can’t let you go
Don’t talk, don’t leave, just quietly hold me girl

[Chorus: Jimin, V]
Hold me tight, hug me
Trust me, trust me, trust me
Hold me tight, hug me
Can you trust me? Can you trust me?
Please, please, please pull me in and hug me

[Post-Chorus: Jungkook, Jimin]
You still shine
You’re still like a scented flower
Now trust me, hold me once again
So I can feel you, hold me

Welcome, first time with BTS?

[Pre-Chorus 1: Jungkook]
Ayo ladies & gentleman
If you’re ready, I’ll start, yeah
Differently from the other guys
With my style with my style

[Pre-Chorus 2: Jimin]
I worked all night, everyday
While you were out clubbing
Don’t be surprised, listen every day
I got a feel, I got a feel

[Chorus]
I’m kinda sick

[Verse 1: J-Hope]
We're drenched, drenched, drenched
In sweat, in our practice room
Look, my great, great, great
Dance moves prove it all
All the weak, loser, whiny idiots
They have nothing on me
Cuz i'm full of hope haha

[Verse 2: Suga]
Ok we're dope from head to toe
Over half of the day, we drown in work
Even if our youth rots in the studio
Thanks to that, we're closer to success
Girls, shout louder
Make it ring, ring

[Pre-Chorus 1: V]
I worked all night, every day
While you were playing in the club
Differently from other guys
I don’t wanna say yes
I don’t wanna say yes

If I had only one day
I will go see the person who created Converse Highs
Then I’ll tell that person, you saved the world
You made that girl born again
F your Chanel F your Alexander Mcqueen

You can buy two pairs with just 100 dollars, you know what I want
White t-shirt, jeans and red Converse Highs, that’s it

Alright, red orange yellow green blue violet indigo
The rainbow on your feet is shot like Rambo
It aims at me, bang bang, shout out wow wow

No thanks, I wanna ride the big bus
Rather than the stars in the sky, I wanna see the stars on your shoes

[Verse 1: RM]
Ayo SUGA
I remember how we came here three years ago
When you and I used to fight all the time
The wallpaper, bathroom and veranda were all blue
Back then I thought this was a big place
But my ambition grew too big
That big house became too small now
When the nine trainees shared a 17-pyung house
Seems like it was just yesterday, we grew up a lot
Good things were always other people’s things
We were always hoarse from an uncertain future and worries
Seeing all the senior artists at the end of the year awards
Let’s not forget those things but put them away
This place smells like us
Let’s not forget this scent, wherever we are
We cried a lot and laughed a lot but it was so beautiful
Nonhyeon-dong, 3rd floor, thank you

[Chorus: V]
Let’s move
Goodbye to this place, that we grew attached to
Let’s move
Now to a higher place
While taking the last box out of the empty room
I looked back for a moment
Times we cried and laughed
Goodbye now

[Verse 2: J-Hope]
Three years felt so short but so long
A lot of things happened, there were many memories
I remember now that we’re about to leave
Traces of being used like bank accounts and credit cards
As much as the place was small, we were bound together tighter
Fight right here, hitting each other sometimes
Maybe that’s why but we have good feelings and bad feelings of love too
Even the dust will be cleared now
There’s more stuff than the beginning, I have more than when I started too
Now let’s take our pride and go toward a bigger world with a bigger dream
A new start, a new beginning
Excited to see how it will become
Move the boxes, hold your place, wipe the dust
After you’re done, let’s get a bowl of black bean noodles, that’s right

[Chorus: Jin]
Let’s move
Goodbye to this place, that we grew attached to
Let’s move
Now to a higher place
While taking the last box out of the empty room
I looked back for a moment
Times we cried and laughed
Goodbye now

[Verse 3: Suga]
Ever since I was born
I counted the days for my first move
I remember, why I had to move
The machine in my mom’s heart and the big scar
In winter of 2010 at Daegu
The childish me used to measure the size of the world
The reason why we moved into a business
Was because of all the bad things people said, saying we follow money
So moving left many things with me
Whether I liked it or not, it changed a lot in my life
My life was about paying rent, I know
I lived with my pride put into the down payment
So I’m gonna move again
I’m gonna have a dream, a level higher than being an idol
When will I stop having to move again?
I hope it comes quickly

[Chorus: Jimin]
Let’s move
Goodbye to this place, that we grew attached to
Let’s move
Now to a higher place
While taking the last box out of the empty room
I looked back for a moment
Times we cried and laughed
Goodbye now

[Chorus: Jungkook]
Let’s move
Goodbye to this place, that we grew attached to
Let’s move
Now to a higher place
While taking the last box out of the empty room
I looked back for a moment
Times we cried and laughed
Goodbye now

[Outro: RM]
Everyone’s afraid of changes
Staying, moving on, staying, moving on
We keep repeating the same things again and again
I guess that’s life, I’m afraid
Old or new, new or old, that isn’t really important
What’s important is, that we still breathe and live in the same place
So let’s move on

[Intro: Jungkook]
Fall Fall Fall, scattering apart
Fall Fall Fall, falling

[Verse 1: Suga]
Because of you, I’m becoming ruined
I wanna stop, I don’t want you anymore
I can’t do it, this sucks
Please don’t give me any excuses

[Verse 2: J-Hope]
You can’t do this to me
All of the things you said are like a mask
It hides the truth and rips me apart
It pierces me, I’m going crazy, I hate this
Take it all away, I hate you

[Verse 3: V, RM, Suga]
But you’re my everything (You’re my)
Everything (You’re my)
Everything (You’re my)
Please go away huh

I’m sorry (I hate you)
I love you (I hate you)
Forgive me

[Chorus: Jimin, Jungkook, RM, Jungkook & RM]
I need you girl
Why am I in love alone, why am I hurting alone
I need you girl
Why do I keep needing you when I know I’ll get hurt?

I need you girl, you’re beautiful
I need you girl, you’re so cold
I need you girl I need you girl
I need you girl I need you girl

[Verse 4: RM, V]
It goes round & round, why do I keep coming back
I go down & down, at this point, I’m just a fool
Whatever I do, I can’t help it
It’s definitely my heart, my feelings but why don’t they listen to me
I’m just talking to myself again, talking to myself again
I’m just talking to myself again, talking to myself again
You’re not saying anything, please, I’ll treat you well
But the sky is blue, the sky is blue

[Verse 5: Jin]
The sky is blue and the sun is shining
So my tears are even more noticeable
Why is it you? Why did it have to be you?
Why can’t I leave you?

[Chorus: Jungkook, Jimin, RM, Jungkook & RM]
I need you girl
Why am I in love alone, why am I hurting alone
I need you girl
Why do I keep needing you when I know I’ll get hurt?

I need you girl, you’re beautiful
I need you girl, you’re so cold
I need you girl I need you girl
I need you girl I need you girl

[Bridge: Jin, V, Jungkook, Jimin]
Girl, just tell me you wanna break up
Girl, just tell me it wasn’t love
I have no courage to say that
Give me my last gift
So I can’t ever go back to you

[Chorus: Jimin, Jungkook, RM, Jungkook & RM]
I need you girl
Why am I in love alone, why am I hurting alone
I need you girl
Why do I keep needing you when I know I’ll get hurt?

I need you girl, you’re beautiful
I need you girl, you’re so cold
I need you girl I need you girl
I need you girl I need you girl

128,hold-me-tight,"

[Verse 1: RM]
I empty my drink but it gets filled with loneliness
I should’ve just given in, why did I argue all the time?
Even the trash bag thrown away on the street makes a lonely sound in the wind
All I did was color you in my white, blank paper
But then I realized, it already became a finished picture
You and I are like cell phones, when we’re apart you know we’ll be broken
Only your scent completes me
Hurry and hug me

[Pre-Chorus: Suga, Jungkook]
I can only see you
I can only see you alone
Look, I’m fair with everyone else but you
Now I can’t live a day without you, please

[Chorus: V, Jimin]
Hold me tight, hug me
Can you trust me? Can you trust me? Can you trust me?
Pull me in tight
Hold me tight, hug me
Can you trust me? Can you trust me?
Please, please, please pull me in and hug me

[Post-Chorus: Jungkook, Jin, Jimin]
You still shine
You’re still like a scented flower
Now trust me, hold me once again
So I can feel you, hold me

Without you, I can’t breathe
I’m nothing without you
Open my closed heart, drench my heart
So I can feel you, hold me

[Verse 2: J-Hope]
Your arms, your warmth, your heart
I want to see it all, I beg you
This moment, even the warm flower scented wind
Even the sky without a single cloud
Everything feels cold and I’m even scared of the clear sky
If you’re not here, I’m just a corpse, so how can I breathe?
It hurts, I’m always cry cry cry
I’m going crazy, exhausted without you
I think of you without stopping
I hate it all, I hate every single day
It makes me cry, ring ding dong
If there’s a chance, I’ll catch you
I’m running, it’s starting, count down
I’m ready to be cut by your rose-like embrace, as I hold you again

[Pre-Chorus: Suga, Jimin]
I can only see you
I can only see you alone
Look, I’m fair with everyone else but you
Now I can’t live a day without you, please

[Chorus: Jungkook, Jin]
Hold me tight, hug me
Can you trust me? Can you trust me? Can you trust me?
Pull me in tight
Hold me tight, hug me
Can you trust me? Can you trust me?
Please, please, please pull me in and hug me

[Bridge: Suga]
Your cold face tells me everything rather than words
I can see a break up rising over me like a high tide
I know it will soon be our last but I can’t let you go
Don’t talk, don’t leave, just quietly hold me girl

[Chorus: Jimin, V]
Hold me tight, hug me
Trust me, trust me, trust me
Hold me tight, hug me
Can you trust me? Can you trust me?
Please, please, please pull me in and hug me

[Post-Chorus: Jungkook, Jimin]
You still shine
You’re still like a scented flower
Now trust me, hold me once again
So I can feel you, hold me

You’re in danger
You’re in danger
You’re in danger
You’re in danger

[Verse 1: RM]
You treat me like this everyday
You only care about yourself like you are just you
I am just I, that’s your kind of formula
Does your phone work right? Really?
Am I really your boy friend? I’m sick of this!
Why are you holding back your expression of love like you put off your homework?
Is it like a business relationship for you? Or Do you hate me or what?
Don't don't dig it, don't don't
Please be more affectionate! I pray for it again today

[Verse 2: Jungkook]
We are like parallel lines. We are so different though we both are looking at the same place
You are the only one that I got inside but I feel like that I’m outside of you
Whenever I turn sulky you ask me, “Are you mad at me?”
Have you ever really done something to me?
You are a sweetie! But I’m just a poor boy
I wish the miracle would happen that you love more than I do

[Pre-Chorus: Jin, Jimin]
You don’t have me inside but I’m full of you. It drives me crazy
But why are you doing this to me?
Why are you making a fool of me? Now I’m warning you!
Don’t get me twisted!

[Chorus: Jungkook, Jimin]
Are you fucking kidding me? What am I to you?
Am I easy to you? Are you playing with me?
You are in danger now
Why are you testing me? Why are you testing me?
Don’t get me twisted

Are you fucking kidding me? What am I to you?
Am I easy to you? Are you playing with me?

You hurt me so!
You hurt me so!
You hurt me so!
Don’t get me twisted
You are too bad to me!
You are too bad to me!
You are too bad to me!
Don’t get me twisted

[Verse 3: J-Hope]
Contact. Absence. Unlock. Wanted
I’m searching for your real intention
You always send me just 1 or 2 line of text messages and that’s it
Was this really love I’ve wanted and dreamed?
Where is the love story filled with ups and downs?
Get soap opera heroes and heroines out of my way!
I am tearing my hair out like hundreds of times
You are so calm and feel no guilty, and you kick my ass

[Verse 4: Suga]
What am I? What am I? What am I to you?
I always heard your news not from yourself but from your friends
Want you. Want you. Uh~ I want you
You are trickster. You are a criminal who shook my heart..
I had already wasted my heart even before it started to burn
My one-way proposes are waste of time
If I was not a lover but just a friend to you, maybe you would feel more comfortable. I’m such a love loser

[Pre-Chorus: Jin, Jimin]
You don’t have me inside but I’m full of you. It drives me crazy
But why are you doing this to me?
Why are you making a fool of me? Now I’m warning you!
Don’t get me twisted!

[Chorus: Jungkook, Jimin]
Are you fucking kidding me? What am I to you?
Am I easy to you? Are you playing with me?

On top of this ending tune
I am standing here alone
Now tell me
That it’s over, let me know

[Verse 1: Suga]
Suddenly, rain wells up in my eyes
You well up, I see you even when I breathe
Love blooms like cherry blossoms but burns and becomes ashes
Hey girl I know, the conclusion you made by yourself
Your hand, your body, your body heat that was hotter than the equator
I’m still here, on repeat on top of the disappeared tune
I’m turning by myself on top of this music that has ended

[Refrain: V]
On top of this ending tune
I am standing here alone
Now tell me
That it’s over, let me know

[Chorus: Jungkook/V]
Girl let me know
Girl let me know
Although I already know everything is over
Just so no regrets are left behind

Girl let me know
Girl let me know
Girl let me know
Tell me something

I just wanna know
I just wanna know
My lingering feelings are trying to withstand the end
So please tell me something, girl let me know

[Verse 2: J-Hope]
The promises we made disappeared with the time we spent together
The dominos have fallen with our breakup
Like Juliet and Romeo
Did I like you too much?
The heat between me and you won’t cool down
Now I look back at the film with you
Too early to do anything by thinking of you
You took away my stars at night, my sun at day
Only leaving me with the darkness of a single cold cloud
If there are hellos, then there’s bound to be goodbyes? Never ever
I don’t care about that, I don’t want to stick to that
I’ll turn away, hypnotizing myself

[Refrain: V]
On top of this ending tune
I am standing here alone
Now tell me
That it’s over, let me know

[Chorus: Jin/Jimin]
Girl let me know
Girl let me know
Although I already know everything is over
Although you’re over me

Girl let me know
Girl let me know
Girl let me know
Tell me something

I just wanna know
I just wanna know
My lingering feelings are trying to withstand the end
So please tell me something, girl let me know

[Bridge: Rap Monster]
Maybe we’re all just a bunch of fools
Everyone lives with a love that has come to an end
It’s not that I still have feelings for you
I know we can’t work out
But why does it feel like I’m having indigestion?
As if my insides will explode, cries come up my throat, making me throw up
In my imagination, I fight with you, make up with you and understand you
Your hand gestures, your eyes, they are faded but not gone
Why won’t it go away?
Why won’t it go away?
Why won’t it go away?

[Chorus: Jungkook/V]
Girl let me know
Girl let me know
Although I already know everything is over
Although you’re over me

Girl let me know
Girl let me know
Girl let me know
Tell me something

I just wanna know
I just wanna know
My lingering feelings are trying to withstand the end
So please tell me something, girl let me know

[Outro: Jungkook]
Let me know

"
134,rain,"

(The thick color of a rainy day in Seoul)
The racing cars, the squirming umbrellas all over the place
It’s cloudy and the air is clear

(The rain stops and the reflection in the puddle)
With a light gray background, why am I standing here?
I don’t know if I have a lot of thoughts or no thoughts at all

I wake up when it’s just about to get bright outside
I brush back my hair when my exhausted hands
The memopad with the song I couldn’t complete last night
I’ll finish it today as I shut my eyes and let out a sigh
What excuse can I give? I try to make something up
It’s unfinished anyway so I’ll just make anything up
Then I turned my eyes to the window and everything looks gray
Gray city, gray buildings, gray roads, gray rain
Everything in this world is slow
My younger sibling who woke up keeps talking back
I keep opening and closing the innocent refrigerator
With the unknown empty feeling that washes over me
I think that I should just go outside
Without even an umbrella
I can clearly hear the rain hitting the earth
I smile, it’s the best background music
Like a crazy guy, I start to hum
I wonder what time it is

The thick color of a rainy day in Seoul
I still can’t fall asleep as I fade away
The rain stops and the reflection in the puddle
I see myself looking more miserable today

It’s a rainy night, the rain knocks on my window, it hits my heart
With my sore shoulders, I look at my phone and see a text, “How are you these days?”
My friend’s text gets my emotions going
As I inhale the scent of the wet rain, I stretch and go to the bathroom
Then I greet myself, half asleep in the mirror
I have no one to meet but I take a longer shower than usual
Rain is still falling outside the house
I have no where to go but I take my umbrella
And walk outside without a plan
As if the rain wants its existence to be known, my shoes get dirty
Am I someone who engraved my existence to you like the rain?
If not, am I just someone who came and went like a rain shower?

The thick color of a rainy day in Seoul
I still can’t fall asleep as I fade away
The rain stops and the reflection in the puddle
I see myself looking more miserable today

I get up and when I feel sore, I look out the window
As if it knows how my body feels, the rain is falling
As I look at the raindrops welling up in the window, I felt it
The tears that were flowing down my heart
With that strange feeling, I look outside and it looks like my situation
The rain that falls like a melody makes everything seem andante
I get ready and leave, opening the umbrella that was as wrinkled as my face
As I walk, the moment I heard the rain
I wondered who this rain was falling for
A sound that hits against the lonely gray cement
Come slow down

The thick color of a rainy day in Seoul
I still can’t fall asleep as I fade away
The rain stops and the reflection in the puddle
I see myself looking more miserable today

Even when this rain stops, when the clouds go away
I stand here, just the same
Without saying anything, looking at the world
There, a not so beautiful me is looking at myself

In this rain
In this rain

135,could-you-turn-off-your-cell-phone,"

Could you turn off your cell phone?
Everyone says it’s smart
But we’re all getting dumber
Could you turn off your cell phone?
Look at my face and give me a mention
I don’t need a Like

You use your phone to even tell me you’re going to the bathroom
You give me a slight smile as if you think you’re smart
It’s not funny at all, I’ve seen you for the first time in months
Why are you pretending to be popular? Did you win the lottery or something?

What do you mean the lotto, snap out of it, I switched to a new phone, friend
It’s the Information Age, as you know half the population of Korea
Are part of the smart 21st century
Talking face to face is an old story now

You haven’t seen each other for a while and you’re fighting again?
Phone? Let’s just eat first, that’s the most us-like thing to do
Do you even have a girlfriend? What a waste of your new phone
I don’t want to be like Young Soo who went to the army, please work your magic
Where do you wanna go? I wanna go there
They say this is the hottest spot
What should we do after we eat? Let’s not go to the PC cafe
But hey, when a person is talking…

Are you eating with your eyes like girls do?
Stop taking pictures, I’m losing my appetite
You’re busy updating again, on Facebook or Twitter
Life is 3D, twitter at me at my face

You twitter and tap tap as you cough cough
Food is spitting out of your mouth as you’re on your phone
Do I need to hit you for you to snap out of it?
When you’re out of battery, do you think we’ll be charged?

Could you turn off your cell phone?
Or put it in your pocket?
Everyone says it’s smart
And the times have gotten better but we’re rushing twice as much
Sometimes, I miss the times when people talked face to face
Communication increased but between us is a noisy silence

Could you turn off your cell phone?
Everyone says it’s smart
But we’re all getting dumber
Could you turn off your cell phone?
Look at my face and give me a mention
I don’t need a Like

I don’t need message or selfies
I didn’t come to see your phone or food, but I came to see you
This isn’t right, we’re closer than that
We were happy just by laughing

136,tomorrow,"

[Verse 1: Suga, V]
Same day, same moon
24/7 every moment repeats
My life is in between
Jobless twenty-somethings are afraid of tomorrow
It’s funny, you think anything is possible when you’re a kid
When you feel how hard it is to get through a day
Keep feeling like the “Control” beat, keep downloading it
Every single day is a repetition of Ctrl+C, Ctrl+V

I have a long way to go but why am I running in place?
I scream out of frustration but the empty air echoes
I hope tomorrow will be different from today
I’m just wishing

[Pre-Chorus: Jungkook]
Follow your dream like breaker
Even if it breaks down, oh better
Follow your dream like breaker
Even if it breaks down, don’t ever run backwards, never

[Chorus: Jungkook, Jin]
Because the dawn right before the sun rises is the darkest
Even in the far future, never forget the you of right now
Wherever you are right now, you’re just taking a break
Don’t give up, you know
Don’t get too far away, tomorrow

[Post-Chorus: Jungkook]
Don’t get far away, tomorrow
Don’t get too far away, tomorrow

[Verse 2: RM, V]
The tomorrow we’ve been waiting for
Becomes the name of yesterday at some point
Tomorrow becomes today, today becomes yesterday
Tomorrow becomes yesterday and is behind me
Life isn’t about living along but living through
As you live through, you’ll disappear some day
If you keep spacing out, you’ll be swept away
If you ain’t no got the guts, trust
It’ll all become yesterday anyway so what’s the use?
I wanted to become happy and strong but why am I getting weaker?
Where am I going? I’m going here and there but I always come back here
Yeah, I’ll probably flow somewhere, is there an end to this maze?

I have a long way to go but why am I running in place?
I scream out of frustration but the empty air echoes
I hope tomorrow will be different from today
I’m just wishing

[Pre-Chorus: Jimin]
Follow your dream like breaker
Even if it breaks down, oh better
Follow your dream like breaker
Even if it breaks down, don’t ever run backwards, never

[Chorus: Jimin, Jin]
Because the dawn right before the sun rises is the darkest
Even in the far future, never forget the you of right now
Wherever you are right now, you’re just taking a break
Don’t give up, you know
Don’t get too far away, tomorrow

[Bridge: J-Hope]
Tomorrow, keep walking, we’re too young to stop
Tomorrow, open the door, we see too much to shut the door
When the dark night passes, a bright morning will come
When tomorrow comes, the bright light will shine so don’t worry
This isn’t a stop but just a pause in your life for a break
Turn up your thumbs and press play so everyone can see

[Pre-Chorus: Jungkook]
Follow your dream like breaker
Even if it breaks down, oh better
Follow your dream like breaker
Even if it breaks down, don’t ever run backwards, never

[Chorus: Jungkook, Jimin]
Because the dawn right before the sun rises is the darkest
Even in the far future, never forget the you of right now
Wherever you are right now, you’re just taking a break
Don’t give up, you know
Don’t get too far away, tomorrow

[Post-Chorus: Jungkook]
Don’t get far away, tomorrow
Don’t get too far away, tomorrow

[Chorus: Jungkook, Jin, Jimin]
(Let’s jump!) Throw your hands up and scream together, pump it up
(Let’s jump!) Throw your hands up and scream together, jumpin up
(Let’s jump!) Let’s jump
(Let’s jump!) Pay attention
(Let’s jump!) Put your hands to the sky and scream together, jumpin up

[Verse 1: Suga, V, All]
The hero you’ve dreamed of since you were young
We used to jump, wanting to be heroes
But now we’ve grown and time has passed
You’re becoming an adult but I wanna rewind
To the times when the 10-year-old boy sang the theme song to his favorite superhero comic
I wanna go back so I close my eyes and scream
But nothing changes, reality is the same

No matter who tries to stop me
I will go on my way
You only live once
Leggo (Leggo!)
Leggo (Leggo!)
Even if I live for a day
I’ll have no regrets
Let’s jump
Let’s jump! (Jump! Jump! Jump! Jump!)

[Verse 2: J-Hope, RM]
2007 is when my life changed
It’s been 7 years since I’ve sang
A killer of girls’ hearts
But sometimes, I go back to those frustrating times
Facing myself, who was like a white piece of paper
That encounter awakens a different me
Now I’ll go up on stage
And surprise everyone by jumping like Jordan
Ball!

Go back a few years
Taking out the trampoline from the corner of the room and jump around in the air
You used to feel the joy of each jump, feeling like you have everything
Letting myself go to the innocent dreams
My childhood days was impatient to be an adult
But each day was filled with joy
So can I be the one, just can I be the one
That I... stop

[Chorus: Jungkook, Jin, Jimin]
(Let’s jump!) Throw your hands up and scream together, pump it up
(Let’s jump!) Throw your hands up and scream together, jumpin up

[Bridge: Suga, RM]
Let’s jump & down, we are here, we are BTS
Beat down, if you’re ready, put your hands up high
It’s different from what you’ve dreamed of when you were little but we have met, we’re heroes, rappers in training
Now jump to the stage, we are the new generation heroes

Seven heroes-in-training, who were once immature, making a jump sound
Instead of a trampoline, the place I need to jump on is the stage, crazily, up down
Now don’t just talk about it, it’s time to spread my wings and go, let’s get it started
Spread your shoulders, rock your body, empty your head, let’s go party

[Outro: All, RM]
(Let’s jump!) All the dreamers
(Let’s jump!) Put your hands up

139,danger,"

[Intro: RM]
You’re in danger
You’re in danger
You’re in danger
You’re in danger

[Verse 1: RM]
You treat me like this everyday
You only care about yourself like you are just you
I am just I, that’s your kind of formula
Does your phone work right? Really?
Am I really your boy friend? I’m sick of this!
Why are you holding back your expression of love like you put off your homework?
Is it like a business relationship for you? Or Do you hate me or what?
Don't don't dig it, don't don't
Please be more affectionate! I pray for it again today

[Verse 2: Jungkook]
We are like parallel lines. We are so different though we both are looking at the same place
You are the only one that I got inside but I feel like that I’m outside of you
Whenever I turn sulky you ask me, “Are you mad at me?”
Have you ever really done something to me?
You are a sweetie! But I’m just a poor boy
I wish the miracle would happen that you love more than I do

[Pre-Chorus: Jin, Jimin]
You don’t have me inside but I’m full of you. It drives me crazy
But why are you doing this to me?
Why are you making a fool of me? Now I’m warning you!
Don’t get me twisted!

[Chorus: Jungkook, Jimin]
Are you fucking kidding me? What am I to you?
Am I easy to you? Are you playing with me?
You are in danger now
Why are you testing me? Why are you testing me?
Don’t get me twisted

[Chorus: V, Jimin]
Are you fucking kidding me? What am I to you?
Am I easy to you? Are you playing with me?
You are in danger now
Why are you testing me? Why are you testing me?
Don’t get me twisted

[Post-Chorus: V, Jimin]
You hurt me so!
You hurt me so!
You hurt me so!
Don’t get me twisted
You are too bad to me!
You are too bad to me!
You are too bad to me!
Don’t get me twisted

[Verse 3: J-Hope]
Contact. Absence. Unlock. Wanted
I’m searching for your real intention
You always send me just 1 or 2 line of text messages and that’s it
Was this really love I’ve wanted and dreamed?
Where is the love story filled with ups and downs?
Get soap opera heroes and heroines out of my way!
I am tearing my hair out like hundreds of times
You are so calm and feel no guilty, and you kick my ass

[Verse 4: Suga]
What am I? What am I? What am I to you?
I always heard your news not from yourself but from your friends
Want you. Want you. Uh~ I want you
You are trickster. You are a criminal who shook my heart..
I had already wasted my heart even before it started to burn
My one-way proposes are waste of time
If I was not a lover but just a friend to you, maybe you would feel more comfortable. I’m such a love loser

[Pre-Chorus: Jin, Jimin]
You don’t have me inside but I’m full of you. It drives me crazy
But why are you doing this to me?
Why are you making a fool of me? Now I’m warning you!
Don’t get me twisted!

[Chorus: Jungkook, Jimin]
Are you fucking kidding me? What am I to you?
Am I easy to you? Are you playing with me?
You are in danger now
Why are you testing me? Why are you testing me?

Are you fucking kidding me? What am I to you?
Am I easy to you? Are you playing with me?

You hurt me so!
You hurt me so!
You hurt me so!
Don’t get me twisted
You are too bad to me!
You are too bad to me!
You are too bad to me!
Don’t get me twisted

140,just-one-day,"

[Intro: Jungkook, RM]
Yeah yeah
Yeah just one, day one night

[Verse 1: Suga]
If only I had just one day
I want to peacefully fall asleep intoxicated with your sweet scent
If there’s a chance in my busy schedule
I want to put my body in your warm and deep eyes
I like that, your long, straight hair
Your breathtaking neck when you
Put it up and the strands that fall out
Wherever we go
My handbag is your waist
Yo ma honey
Whenever I see you I run out of breath like the streets of Myungdong
Our BGM is the sound of breathing
Your voice when you say my name
I wanna be locked in you and swim in you
I want to know you more, an explorer venturing through your deep forest of mystery
I appreciate the masterpiece that is you because your existence alone is art
I imagine this all night every day
Because it’s a meaningless dream anyway

[Chorus: Jungkook]
Just one day, if I can be with you
Just one day, if I can hold your hands
Just one day, if I can be with you
Just one day (just one day)
If only we can be together

[Post-Chorus: All, Jin, J-Hope, Jimin, V]
(Do it do it do it)
I hope I can be with you for just one day
(Do it do it do it)
Having a party party with only you
(Do it do it do it)
I hope I can be with you for just one day
(Do it do it do it)
A party party with only you

[Verse 2: V, RM]
If only I could do that, how nice would it be
If only we could go anywhere
To eat and watch a movie comfortably
I would do anything girl
I’m sorry
Maybe I’m too rational
But still, if you see me some day, smile
Maybe you resent me a little or no, a lot
I know, I couldn’t look at you more because of my dream
Then just give me one day
Even if it’s in my dream, just one day
Out of all those words I had to swallow
Because of the excuse of reality
I’ll pick one and tell it to you for sure
Let’s meet when the lilies bloom
And say goodbye when they wither
I didn’t think I’d get over you easily but
Is it selfish of me to hope you are the same?
I’m still lying, saying that it’s all for you
You are standing in the center of my life

[Chorus: Jungkook, V]
Just one day, if I can be with you
Just one day, if I can hold your hands
Just one day, if I can be with you
Just one day (just one day)

[Bridge: J-Hope]
If you are and I are together, let’s go time
24 hours, if I could only be with you
I’d kiss you starting from the morning
Can’t forget to grab some brunch
I’d hold your hand and soak up the sun
It’s not over yet, in the middle of a beautiful night
I’ll confess to you, with the moon as our light
All of these things tell me
“If I have just one day, it’s possible”

[Chorus: Jungkook, Jin, Jimin & Jin]
Just one day, if I can be with you
Just one day, if I can hold your hands
Just one day, if I can be with you
Just one day (just one day)
If only we can be together

[Post-Chorus: V, Jimin, J-Hope, Jungkook]
(Do it do it do it)
I hope I can be with you for just one day
(Do it do it do it)
Having a party party with only you
(Do it do it do it)
I hope I can be with you for just one day
(Do it do it do it)
A party party with only you

[Outro: Jungkook, Jimin, RM]
Just one day, if I can be with you
Just one day, if I can hold your hands
Just one day, if I can be with you
Just one day (just one day)
If only we can be together

Can you please stay with me?

[Pre-hook: RM]
Hey, what's your dream?
Hey, what’s your dream?
Hey, what's your dream?
Hey, is that your dream?

[Verse 1: Suga, RM, Jungkook]
I wanna big house, big cars & big rings
But in real, I don't have any big dreams
Haha I live an easy life
Even if I don’t dream, no one says anything to me
Everyone is thinking the same as me
When we were still young
I said I'll go to some university
Okay, mum, I'm going to the library

[Pre-Chorus: V, J-Hope]
What is you that you dreamed of?
Who do you see in your mirror, I gotta say
Go your own way
Even if you live a day
Do something
Put weakness away

[Verse 2: Jungkook]
Why don't you say anything? You don't want to study
You're too afraid to quit the school, right? See, you're getting ready for school
Grow up, don't just talk, You have a weak mind boy
(Stop!) ask yourself, when did you try hard

[Pre-hook: RM]
Hey, what’s your dream?
Hey, what’s your dream?
Hey, what's your dream?
Hey, is that your dream?

See me, see me ya, you're hypocrite
Why are you telling me to go another way? Do well yourself!
Don't push others!

What’s you dream? What's your dream?
(La la la la la)
Is that your dream? Is that your dream?

[Verse 3: Suga]
Boring same day, every day repeats
Adults and parents tell us the same dream
Future job number one, public officials?
It's not a forced dream, a relief pitcher

[Verse 4: J-Hope]
Throw a fast ball on the after school studying
Disobey the hell like society pardon the dream
Ask yourself 'bout the profile of your dream
Become the subject of your own life, away from suppression

[Pre-Chorus: Jin, Jimin]
What is you that you dreamed of?
Who do you see in your mirror, I gotta say
Go your own way
Even if you live a day

Is that your dream? Is that your dream?

[Bridge: RM, Suga, Jungkook]
Don't know how to live
Don't know how to fly
Don't know how to decide
Don't know how to dream now

Open, open, open your eyes again
Dance, dance, dance again
Dream, dream, dream again
Don't hesitate, don't hesitate, wassup!

[Chorus: Jungkook, RM]
It's a lie you're such a liar
See me, see me ya, you're hypocrite
Why are you telling me to go another way? Do well yourself!
Don't push others!
(La la la la la)
What's you dream? What's your dream?
(La la la la la)
Is that your dream? Is that your dream?

[Outro: RM]
To all the youngsters without dreams

"
142,danger,"

[Intro: RM]
You’re in danger
You’re in danger
You’re in danger
You’re in danger

[Verse 1: RM]
You treat me like this everyday
You only care about yourself like you are just you
I am just I, that’s your kind of formula
Does your phone work right? Really?
Am I really your boy friend? I’m sick of this!
Why are you holding back your expression of love like you put off your homework?
Is it like a business relationship for you? Or Do you hate me or what?
Don't don't dig it, don't don't
Please be more affectionate! I pray for it again today

[Verse 2: Jungkook]
We are like parallel lines. We are so different though we both are looking at the same place
You are the only one that I got inside but I feel like that I’m outside of you
Whenever I turn sulky you ask me, “Are you mad at me?”
Have you ever really done something to me?
You are a sweetie! But I’m just a poor boy
I wish the miracle would happen that you love more than I do

[Pre-Chorus: Jin, Jimin]
You don’t have me inside but I’m full of you. It drives me crazy
But why are you doing this to me?
Why are you making a fool of me? Now I’m warning you!
Don’t get me twisted!

[Chorus: Jungkook, Jimin]
Are you fucking kidding me? What am I to you?
Am I easy to you? Are you playing with me?
You are in danger now
Why are you testing me? Why are you testing me?
Don’t get me twisted

[Chorus: V, Jimin]
Are you fucking kidding me? What am I to you?
Am I easy to you? Are you playing with me?
You are in danger now
Why are you testing me? Why are you testing me?
Don’t get me twisted

[Post-Chorus: V, Jimin]
You hurt me so!
You hurt me so!
You hurt me so!
Don’t get me twisted
You are too bad to me!
You are too bad to me!
You are too bad to me!
Don’t get me twisted

[Verse 3: J-Hope]
Contact. Absence. Unlock. Wanted
I’m searching for your real intention
You always send me just 1 or 2 line of text messages and that’s it
Was this really love I’ve wanted and dreamed?
Where is the love story filled with ups and downs?
Get soap opera heroes and heroines out of my way!
I am tearing my hair out like hundreds of times
You are so calm and feel no guilty, and you kick my ass

[Verse 4: Suga]
What am I? What am I? What am I to you?
I always heard your news not from yourself but from your friends
Want you. Want you. Uh~ I want you
You are trickster. You are a criminal who shook my heart..
I had already wasted my heart even before it started to burn
My one-way proposes are waste of time
If I was not a lover but just a friend to you, maybe you would feel more comfortable. I’m such a love loser

[Pre-Chorus: Jin, Jimin]
You don’t have me inside but I’m full of you. It drives me crazy
But why are you doing this to me?
Why are you making a fool of me? Now I’m warning you!
Don’t get me twisted!

[Chorus: Jungkook, Jimin]
Are you fucking kidding me? What am I to you?
Am I easy to you? Are you playing with me?
You are in danger now
Why are you testing me? Why are you testing me?
Don’t get me twisted

[Chorus: V, Jimin]
Are you fucking kidding me? What am I to you?
Am I easy to you? Are you playing with me?
You are in danger now
Why are you testing me? Why are you testing me?
Don’t get me twisted

[Post-Chorus: V, Jimin]
You hurt me so!
You hurt me so!
You hurt me so!
Don’t get me twisted
You are too bad to me!
You are too bad to me!
You are too bad to me!
Don’t get me twisted

"
143,let-me-know,"

[Intro: V]
On top of this ending tune
I am standing here alone
Now tell me
That it’s over, let me know

[Verse 1: Suga]
Suddenly, rain wells up in my eyes
You well up, I see you even when I breathe
Love blooms like cherry blossoms but burns and becomes ashes
Hey girl I know, the conclusion you made by yourself
Your hand, your body, your body heat that was hotter than the equator
I’m still here, on repeat on top of the disappeared tune
I’m turning by myself on top of this music that has ended

[Refrain: V]
On top of this ending tune
I am standing here alone
Now tell me
That it’s over, let me know

[Chorus: Jungkook/V]
Girl let me know
Girl let me know
Although I already know everything is over
Just so no regrets are left behind

Girl let me know
Girl let me know
Girl let me know
Tell me something

I just wanna know
I just wanna know
My lingering feelings are trying to withstand the end
So please tell me something, girl let me know

[Verse 2: J-Hope]
The promises we made disappeared with the time we spent together
The dominos have fallen with our breakup
Like Juliet and Romeo
Did I like you too much?
The heat between me and you won’t cool down
Now I look back at the film with you
Too early to do anything by thinking of you
You took away my stars at night, my sun at day
Only leaving me with the darkness of a single cold cloud
If there are hellos, then there’s bound to be goodbyes? Never ever
I don’t care about that, I don’t want to stick to that
I’ll turn away, hypnotizing myself

[Refrain: V]
On top of this ending tune
I am standing here alone
Now tell me
That it’s over, let me know

[Chorus: Jin/Jimin]
Girl let me know
Girl let me know
Although I already know everything is over
Although you’re over me

Girl let me know
Girl let me know
Girl let me know
Tell me something

I just wanna know
I just wanna know
My lingering feelings are trying to withstand the end
So please tell me something, girl let me know

[Bridge: Rap Monster]
Maybe we’re all just a bunch of fools
Everyone lives with a love that has come to an end
It’s not that I still have feelings for you
I know we can’t work out
But why does it feel like I’m having indigestion?
As if my insides will explode, cries come up my throat, making me throw up
In my imagination, I fight with you, make up with you and understand you
Your hand gestures, your eyes, they are faded but not gone
Why won’t it go away?
Why won’t it go away?
Why won’t it go away?

[Chorus: Jungkook/V]
Girl let me know
Girl let me know
Although I already know everything is over
Although you’re over me

Girl let me know
Girl let me know
Girl let me know
Tell me something

I just wanna know
I just wanna know
My lingering feelings are trying to withstand the end
So please tell me something, girl let me know

[Outro: Jungkook]
Let me know

"
144,rain,"

(The thick color of a rainy day in Seoul)
The racing cars, the squirming umbrellas all over the place
It’s cloudy and the air is clear

(The rain stops and the reflection in the puddle)
With a light gray background, why am I standing here?
I don’t know if I have a lot of thoughts or no thoughts at all

I wake up when it’s just about to get bright outside
I brush back my hair when my exhausted hands
The memopad with the song I couldn’t complete last night
I’ll finish it today as I shut my eyes and let out a sigh
What excuse can I give? I try to make something up
It’s unfinished anyway so I’ll just make anything up
Then I turned my eyes to the window and everything looks gray
Gray city, gray buildings, gray roads, gray rain
Everything in this world is slow
My younger sibling who woke up keeps talking back
I keep opening and closing the innocent refrigerator
With the unknown empty feeling that washes over me
I think that I should just go outside
Without even an umbrella
I can clearly hear the rain hitting the earth
I smile, it’s the best background music
Like a crazy guy, I start to hum
I wonder what time it is

The thick color of a rainy day in Seoul
I still can’t fall asleep as I fade away
The rain stops and the reflection in the puddle
I see myself looking more miserable today

It’s a rainy night, the rain knocks on my window, it hits my heart
With my sore shoulders, I look at my phone and see a text, “How are you these days?”
My friend’s text gets my emotions going
As I inhale the scent of the wet rain, I stretch and go to the bathroom
Then I greet myself, half asleep in the mirror
I have no one to meet but I take a longer shower than usual
Rain is still falling outside the house
I have no where to go but I take my umbrella
And walk outside without a plan
As if the rain wants its existence to be known, my shoes get dirty
Am I someone who engraved my existence to you like the rain?
If not, am I just someone who came and went like a rain shower?

The thick color of a rainy day in Seoul
I still can’t fall asleep as I fade away
The rain stops and the reflection in the puddle
I see myself looking more miserable today

I get up and when I feel sore, I look out the window
As if it knows how my body feels, the rain is falling
As I look at the raindrops welling up in the window, I felt it
The tears that were flowing down my heart
With that strange feeling, I look outside and it looks like my situation
The rain that falls like a melody makes everything seem andante
I get ready and leave, opening the umbrella that was as wrinkled as my face
As I walk, the moment I heard the rain
I wondered who this rain was falling for
A sound that hits against the lonely gray cement
Come slow down

The thick color of a rainy day in Seoul
I still can’t fall asleep as I fade away
The rain stops and the reflection in the puddle
I see myself looking more miserable today

Even when this rain stops, when the clouds go away
I stand here, just the same
Without saying anything, looking at the world
There, a not so beautiful me is looking at myself

In this rain
In this rain

145,could-you-turn-off-your-cell-phone,"

Could you turn off your cell phone?
Everyone says it’s smart
But we’re all getting dumber
Could you turn off your cell phone?
Look at my face and give me a mention
I don’t need a Like

You use your phone to even tell me you’re going to the bathroom
You give me a slight smile as if you think you’re smart
It’s not funny at all, I’ve seen you for the first time in months
Why are you pretending to be popular? Did you win the lottery or something?

What do you mean the lotto, snap out of it, I switched to a new phone, friend
It’s the Information Age, as you know half the population of Korea
Are part of the smart 21st century
Talking face to face is an old story now

You haven’t seen each other for a while and you’re fighting again?
Phone? Let’s just eat first, that’s the most us-like thing to do
Do you even have a girlfriend? What a waste of your new phone
I don’t want to be like Young Soo who went to the army, please work your magic
Where do you wanna go? I wanna go there
They say this is the hottest spot
What should we do after we eat? Let’s not go to the PC cafe
But hey, when a person is talking…

Could you turn off your cell phone?
Everyone says it’s smart
But we’re all getting dumber
Could you turn off your cell phone?
Look at my face and give me a mention
I don’t need a Like

Push to unlock, push to unlock
I hate your (tap) I hate your (whoosh)
Push to unlock, push to unlock
Push your (click click) push your (click)

Are you eating with your eyes like girls do?
Stop taking pictures, I’m losing my appetite
You’re busy updating again, on Facebook or Twitter
Life is 3D, twitter at me at my face

You twitter and tap tap as you cough cough
Food is spitting out of your mouth as you’re on your phone
Do I need to hit you for you to snap out of it?
When you’re out of battery, do you think we’ll be charged?

Could you turn off your cell phone?
Or put it in your pocket?
Everyone says it’s smart
And the times have gotten better but we’re rushing twice as much
Sometimes, I miss the times when people talked face to face
Communication increased but between us is a noisy silence

Could you turn off your cell phone?
Everyone says it’s smart
But we’re all getting dumber
Could you turn off your cell phone?
Look at my face and give me a mention
I don’t need a Like

I don’t need message or selfies
I didn’t come to see your phone or food, but I came to see you
This isn’t right, we’re closer than that
We were happy just by laughing

Could you turn off your cell phone?
Everyone says it’s smart
But we’re all getting dumber
Could you turn off your cell phone?
Look at my face and give me a mention

146,miss-right,"

[Intro: RM, All]
You're my Miss Right, Miss Right
If I lose you, it’s a miss, right? Miss Right? (All Right)
You're my Miss Right, Miss Right
Girl you want my kiss, right? Miss Right (All Right)

[Verse 1: RM]
Your sexy mind and your sexy body
You were even born with sexy brain wrinkles
Just in jeans, a white tee and converse high tops
That makes me wanna party on your body
At the end of of your long, shiny hair
Your gentle hips sing
You’re like a forest, shining inside the city
With that unrealistic body, you embrace my reality
And I want you to be really really real for me
Sometimes like my mom, sometimes you’re my energy
I’m an honest guy
I’m so nice on the outside that my enemies can’t stop being honest
You’re so different from the normal people outside
That’s why you’re called the ideal type
Yeah, when I think of you, my heart grows cold
You’re my winter ocean, I want to walk by you

[Chorus: V, Jungkook]
Yes you’re my only girl, you’re the best
I want to know about your day, I want to become your sighs
Yes you’re my only girl, you’re the best
You’re someone who only exists in the movies

[Post-Chorus: V, Jungkook]
Even the weather is good, I think I’m perfect with you
Wanna walk together? Wanna walk together?
Even the weather is good, I think I’m perfect with you
You’re someone who only exists in novels
It’s you

[Verse 2: Suga]
How can a person be like this?
I start to feel like I’m the only one living in this world
You pass by my side
A sweet wind called you is blowing in my heart
Even if you don’t put on makeup
You’ll put on your perfume called Attraction
I never believed that there was a god
But now you make me believe because to me, you’re a goddess
Whether you’re young or old, whether you have a hidden child
I don’t care because I love you
If I’m with you, anywhere we go is a flower garden
Instead of holding designer bags, you hold my hand
Instead of jealousy and envy, you understand my nature
With you, I draw out my future
In between our couple shoes are a pair of baby sneakers

[Chorus: Jungkook, Jin, Jimin]
Yes you’re my only girl, you’re the best
I want to know about your day, I want to become your sighs
Yes you’re my only girl, you’re the best
You’re someone who only exists in the movies
It’s you

[Bridge: J-Hope, RM]
I think she has come, I’m in front of the person who shakes up my heart
I think I’m attracted to you like a magnet, right now
Your life, your heart, your face, your line
Like a piece of a puzzle, you fit into my ideal type
Oh god, I’m like the wind that is led by the weather that is you
You’re a flower, I’m a bee, I’m only going toward you

Yo
I told you many qualifications ’bout my MISS RIGHT
But why you’re my MISS RIGHT is... you are...
Just you

[Chorus: V, Jungkook & Jimin, Jin]
Yes you’re my only girl, you’re the best
I want to know about your day, I want to become your sighs
Yes you’re my only girl, you’re the best
You’re someone who only exists in the movies

[Post-Chorus: V, Jungkook, Jungkook & Jimin, Jimin]
Even the weather is good, I think I’m perfect with you
Wanna walk together? Wanna walk together?
Even the weather is good, I think I’m perfect with you

147,just-one-day,"

[Intro: Jungkook, RM]
Yeah yeah
Yeah just one, day one night

[Verse 1: Suga]
If only I had just one day
I want to peacefully fall asleep intoxicated with your sweet scent
If there’s a chance in my busy schedule
I want to put my body in your warm and deep eyes
I like that, your long, straight hair
Your breathtaking neck when you
Put it up and the strands that fall out
Wherever we go
My handbag is your waist
Yo ma honey
Whenever I see you I run out of breath like the streets of Myungdong
Our BGM is the sound of breathing
Your voice when you say my name
I wanna be locked in you and swim in you
I want to know you more, an explorer venturing through your deep forest of mystery
I appreciate the masterpiece that is you because your existence alone is art
I imagine this all night every day
Because it’s a meaningless dream anyway

[Chorus: Jungkook]
Just one day, if I can be with you
Just one day, if I can hold your hands
Just one day, if I can be with you
Just one day (just one day)
If only we can be together

[Post-Chorus: All, Jin, J-Hope, Jimin, V]
(Do it do it do it)
I hope I can be with you for just one day
(Do it do it do it)
Having a party party with only you
(Do it do it do it)
I hope I can be with you for just one day
(Do it do it do it)
A party party with only you

[Verse 2: V, RM]
If only I could do that, how nice would it be
If only we could go anywhere
To eat and watch a movie comfortably
I would do anything girl
I’m sorry
Maybe I’m too rational
But still, if you see me some day, smile
Maybe you resent me a little or no, a lot
I know, I couldn’t look at you more because of my dream
Then just give me one day
Even if it’s in my dream, just one day
Out of all those words I had to swallow
Because of the excuse of reality
I’ll pick one and tell it to you for sure
Let’s meet when the lilies bloom
And say goodbye when they wither
I didn’t think I’d get over you easily but
Is it selfish of me to hope you are the same?
I’m still lying, saying that it’s all for you
You are standing in the center of my life

[Chorus: Jungkook, V]
Just one day, if I can be with you
Just one day, if I can hold your hands
Just one day, if I can be with you
Just one day (just one day)

[Bridge: J-Hope]
If you are and I are together, let’s go time
24 hours, if I could only be with you
I’d kiss you starting from the morning
Can’t forget to grab some brunch
I’d hold your hand and soak up the sun
It’s not over yet, in the middle of a beautiful night
I’ll confess to you, with the moon as our light
All of these things tell me
“If I have just one day, it’s possible”

[Chorus: Jungkook, Jin, Jimin & Jin]
Just one day, if I can be with you
Just one day, if I can hold your hands
Just one day, if I can be with you
Just one day (just one day)
If only we can be together

[Post-Chorus: V, Jimin, J-Hope, Jungkook]
(Do it do it do it)
I hope I can be with you for just one day
(Do it do it do it)
Having a party party with only you
(Do it do it do it)
I hope I can be with you for just one day
(Do it do it do it)
A party party with only you

[Outro: Jungkook, Jimin, RM]
Just one day, if I can be with you
Just one day, if I can hold your hands
Just one day, if I can be with you
Just one day (just one day)
If only we can be together

Can you please stay with me?

"
148,tomorrow,"

[Verse 1: Suga, V]
Same day, same moon
24/7 every moment repeats
My life is in between
Jobless twenty-somethings are afraid of tomorrow
It’s funny, you think anything is possible when you’re a kid
When you feel how hard it is to get through a day
Keep feeling like the “Control” beat, keep downloading it
Every single day is a repetition of Ctrl+C, Ctrl+V

I have a long way to go but why am I running in place?
I scream out of frustration but the empty air echoes
I hope tomorrow will be different from today
I’m just wishing

[Pre-Chorus: Jungkook]
Follow your dream like breaker
Even if it breaks down, oh better
Follow your dream like breaker
Even if it breaks down, don’t ever run backwards, never

[Chorus: Jungkook, Jin]
Because the dawn right before the sun rises is the darkest
Even in the far future, never forget the you of right now
Wherever you are right now, you’re just taking a break
Don’t give up, you know
Don’t get too far away, tomorrow

[Post-Chorus: Jungkook]
Don’t get far away, tomorrow
Don’t get too far away, tomorrow

[Verse 2: RM, V]
The tomorrow we’ve been waiting for
Becomes the name of yesterday at some point
Tomorrow becomes today, today becomes yesterday
Tomorrow becomes yesterday and is behind me
Life isn’t about living along but living through
As you live through, you’ll disappear some day
If you keep spacing out, you’ll be swept away
If you ain’t no got the guts, trust
It’ll all become yesterday anyway so what’s the use?
I wanted to become happy and strong but why am I getting weaker?
Where am I going? I’m going here and there but I always come back here
Yeah, I’ll probably flow somewhere, is there an end to this maze?

I have a long way to go but why am I running in place?
I scream out of frustration but the empty air echoes
I hope tomorrow will be different from today
I’m just wishing

[Pre-Chorus: Jimin]
Follow your dream like breaker
Even if it breaks down, oh better
Follow your dream like breaker
Even if it breaks down, don’t ever run backwards, never

[Chorus: Jimin, Jin]
Because the dawn right before the sun rises is the darkest
Even in the far future, never forget the you of right now
Wherever you are right now, you’re just taking a break
Don’t give up, you know
Don’t get too far away, tomorrow

[Bridge: J-Hope]
Tomorrow, keep walking, we’re too young to stop
Tomorrow, open the door, we see too much to shut the door
When the dark night passes, a bright morning will come
When tomorrow comes, the bright light will shine so don’t worry
This isn’t a stop but just a pause in your life for a break
Turn up your thumbs and press play so everyone can see

[Pre-Chorus: Jungkook]
Follow your dream like breaker
Even if it breaks down, oh better
Follow your dream like breaker
Even if it breaks down, don’t ever run backwards, never

[Chorus: Jungkook, Jimin]
Because the dawn right before the sun rises is the darkest
Even in the far future, never forget the you of right now
Wherever you are right now, you’re just taking a break
Don’t give up, you know
Don’t get too far away, tomorrow

[Post-Chorus: Jungkook]
Don’t get far away, tomorrow
Don’t get too far away, tomorrow

Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah
(La la la la la la la la la)
Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah
(La la la la la la la la la)
You know BTS is back!

[Verse 1: Suga]
With shoes worth a couple hundred, padded jacket worth a couple thousand
With a watch worth a couple hundred you feel good about yourself
Education goes over the hill and student identity goes over the hill too
The class system of the 21st century is divided into two
Those who have and those who haven’t
Those who wear the shoes and those who don’t
Those who have the clothes and those who don’t
And those who try hard to get those things
What’s going on? Are you falling behind on the trend?
You whined and complained to get it, did I strike a nerve?
In your padded jacket, your greed fills it up
Even after seeing your parents’ curved spines, you’re so coldhearted
You complain that all your friends have it and that they should buy it for you
(Ayo baby) stop being so immature
You won’t freeze just because you don’t have that jacket
Fill your head with good sense before it’s too late

[Chorus: V, Jungkook]
Wow, it feels good, putting on your dirty clothes
You’re something different, rockin, rollin, swaggin, swagger, wrong!
What is wrong with you? You’re crazy baby
That is what will suffocate your heart, dirty clothes

[Hook: (All), Jungkook, Jin, Jimin, RM]
(La la la la la la la la la)
You are a spine breaker
(La la la la la la la la la)
Your parent’s spine breaker
(La la la la la la la la la)
Some day, you’ll regret it
(La la la la la la la la la)
Those damn spine breakers

[Verse 2: RM]
What’s up, kid? You don’t know how good you have it these days
Maybe I’m crossing the line for butting in other people’s lives
Why do you keep saying those empty words?
I’m saying I’ll spend my own money that I received
You’ll only be satisfied if I spend my money like you spend yours
Please go take care of yourself
It’s about your life, if you were me, I wouldn’t say anything
Yeah, my jacket is really expensive and not pretty at all
(But I say) I really want it so what do I do?
Friends who are poorer than me have it too
(And I say) I have no choice but to buy it if I don’t wanna be an outcast
People my age are all like this
Yeah I dunno, yes I’m loco, is it no-no?
I know they ain’t cheap but they got mojos
But I do what I gotta do, I don’t break my parent’s spines
The true beaker is you, who is old and stuck in your room

[Chorus: V, Jungkook]
Wow, it feels good, putting on your dirty clothes
You’re something different, rockin, rollin, swaggin, swagger, wrong
What is wrong with you? You’re crazy baby
That is what will suffocate your heart, dirty clothes

[Bridge: J-Hope]
Dirty clothes for you, dirty clothes for me
Everyone experienced it before
Wearing expensive clothes and walking on the street, feeling good about yourself
Everyone looks smaller than me like I’m Gulliver
Whatever you wear, I understand but you’re too much
You’re gonna regret it
You can keep your swag on but how about your parents?
Fine, I won’t stop you but make a decision now

[Chorus: V, Jungkook]
Wow, it feels good, putting on your dirty clothes
You’re something different, rockin, rollin, swaggin, swagger, wrong!
What is wrong with you? You’re crazy baby
That is what will suffocate your heart, dirty clothes

The hero you’ve dreamed of since you were young
We used to jump, wanting to be heroes
But now we’ve grown and time has passed
You’re becoming an adult but I wanna rewind
To the times when the 10-year-old boy sang the theme song to his favorite superhero comic
I wanna go back so I close my eyes and scream
But nothing changes, reality is the same

No matter who tries to stop me
I will go on my way
You only live once
Leggo (Leggo!)
Leggo (Leggo!)
Even if I live for a day
I’ll have no regrets
Let’s jump
Let’s jump! (Jump! Jump! Jump! Jump!)

[Chorus: Jungkook, Jin, Jimin]
(Let’s jump!) Throw your hands up and scream together, pump it up
(Let’s jump!) Throw your hands up and scream together, jumpin up
(Let’s jump!) Let’s jump
(Let’s jump!) Pay attention
(Let’s jump!) Put your hands to the sky and scream together, jumpin up

[Hook: Suga, All, RM]
Everybody say

(Let’s jump!) All the dreamers
(Let’s jump!) Put your hands up
(Let’s jump!) Throw your worries away
Let’s jump! jump! ju-ju-ju-jump!

(Let’s jump!) All the dreamers
(Let’s jump!) Put your hands up
(Let’s jump!) Throw your worries away
Let’s jump! jump! ju-ju-ju-jump!

[Verse 2: J-Hope, RM]
2007 is when my life changed
It’s been 7 years since I’ve sang
A killer of girls’ hearts
But sometimes, I go back to those frustrating times
Facing myself, who was like a white piece of paper
That encounter awakens a different me
Now I’ll go up on stage
And surprise everyone by jumping like Jordan
Ball!

Go back a few years
Taking out the trampoline from the corner of the room and jump around in the air
You used to feel the joy of each jump, feeling like you have everything
Letting myself go to the innocent dreams
My childhood days was impatient to be an adult
But each day was filled with joy
So can I be the one, just can I be the one
That I... stop

[Chorus: Jungkook, Jin, Jimin]
(Let’s jump!) Throw your hands up and scream together, pump it up
(Let’s jump!) Throw your hands up and scream together, jumpin up
(Let’s jump!) Let’s jump
(Let’s jump!) Pay attention
(Let’s jump!) Put your hands to the sky and scream together, jumpin up

[Bridge: Suga, RM]
Let’s jump & down, we are here, we are BTS
Beat down, if you’re ready, put your hands up high
It’s different from what you’ve dreamed of when you were little but we have met, we’re heroes, rappers in training
Now jump to the stage, we are the new generation heroes

Seven heroes-in-training, who were once immature, making a jump sound
Instead of a trampoline, the place I need to jump on is the stage, crazily, up down
Now don’t just talk about it, it’s time to spread my wings and go, let’s get it started
Spread your shoulders, rock your body, empty your head, let’s go party

[Outro: All, RM]
(Let’s jump!) All the dreamers
(Let’s jump!) Put your hands up
(Let’s jump!) Throw your worries away

(Let’s jump!) All the dreamers
(Let’s jump!) Put your hands up
(Let’s jump!) Throw your worries away

(Let’s jump!) All the dreamers
(Let’s jump!) Put your hands up
(Let’s jump!) Throw your worries away

151,just-one-day,"

[Intro: Jungkook, RM]
Yeah yeah
Yeah just one, day one night

[Verse 1: Suga]
If only I had just one day
I want to peacefully fall asleep intoxicated with your sweet scent
If there’s a chance in my busy schedule
I want to put my body in your warm and deep eyes
I like that, your long, straight hair
Your breathtaking neck when you
Put it up and the strands that fall out
Wherever we go
My handbag is your waist
Yo ma honey
Whenever I see you I run out of breath like the streets of Myungdong
Our BGM is the sound of breathing
Your voice when you say my name
I wanna be locked in you and swim in you
I want to know you more, an explorer venturing through your deep forest of mystery
I appreciate the masterpiece that is you because your existence alone is art
I imagine this all night every day
Because it’s a meaningless dream anyway

[Chorus: Jungkook]
Just one day, if I can be with you
Just one day, if I can hold your hands
Just one day, if I can be with you
Just one day (just one day)
If only we can be together

[Post-Chorus: All, Jin, J-Hope, Jimin, V]
(Do it do it do it)
I hope I can be with you for just one day
(Do it do it do it)
Having a party party with only you
(Do it do it do it)
I hope I can be with you for just one day
(Do it do it do it)
A party party with only you

[Verse 2: V, RM]
If only I could do that, how nice would it be
If only we could go anywhere
To eat and watch a movie comfortably
I would do anything girl
I’m sorry
Maybe I’m too rational
But still, if you see me some day, smile
Maybe you resent me a little or no, a lot
I know, I couldn’t look at you more because of my dream
Then just give me one day
Even if it’s in my dream, just one day
Out of all those words I had to swallow
Because of the excuse of reality
I’ll pick one and tell it to you for sure
Let’s meet when the lilies bloom
And say goodbye when they wither
I didn’t think I’d get over you easily but
Is it selfish of me to hope you are the same?
I’m still lying, saying that it’s all for you
You are standing in the center of my life

[Chorus: Jungkook, V]
Just one day, if I can be with you
Just one day, if I can hold your hands
Just one day, if I can be with you
Just one day (just one day)

[Bridge: J-Hope]
If you are and I are together, let’s go time
24 hours, if I could only be with you
I’d kiss you starting from the morning
Can’t forget to grab some brunch
I’d hold your hand and soak up the sun
It’s not over yet, in the middle of a beautiful night
I’ll confess to you, with the moon as our light
All of these things tell me
“If I have just one day, it’s possible”

[Chorus: Jungkook, Jin, Jimin & Jin]
Just one day, if I can be with you
Just one day, if I can hold your hands
Just one day, if I can be with you
Just one day (just one day)
If only we can be together

[Post-Chorus: V, Jimin, J-Hope, Jungkook]
(Do it do it do it)
I hope I can be with you for just one day
(Do it do it do it)
Having a party party with only you
(Do it do it do it)
I hope I can be with you for just one day
(Do it do it do it)
A party party with only you

[Outro: Jungkook, Jimin, RM]
Just one day, if I can be with you
Just one day, if I can hold your hands
Just one day, if I can be with you
Just one day (just one day)
If only we can be together

Can you please stay with me?

"
152,tomorrow,"

[Verse 1: Suga, V]
Same day, same moon
24/7 every moment repeats
My life is in between
Jobless twenty-somethings are afraid of tomorrow
It’s funny, you think anything is possible when you’re a kid
When you feel how hard it is to get through a day
Keep feeling like the “Control” beat, keep downloading it
Every single day is a repetition of Ctrl+C, Ctrl+V

I have a long way to go but why am I running in place?
I scream out of frustration but the empty air echoes
I hope tomorrow will be different from today
I’m just wishing

[Pre-Chorus: Jungkook]
Follow your dream like breaker
Even if it breaks down, oh better
Follow your dream like breaker
Even if it breaks down, don’t ever run backwards, never

[Chorus: Jungkook, Jin]
Because the dawn right before the sun rises is the darkest
Even in the far future, never forget the you of right now
Wherever you are right now, you’re just taking a break
Don’t give up, you know
Don’t get too far away, tomorrow

[Post-Chorus: Jungkook]
Don’t get far away, tomorrow
Don’t get too far away, tomorrow

[Verse 2: RM, V]
The tomorrow we’ve been waiting for
Becomes the name of yesterday at some point
Tomorrow becomes today, today becomes yesterday
Tomorrow becomes yesterday and is behind me
Life isn’t about living along but living through
As you live through, you’ll disappear some day
If you keep spacing out, you’ll be swept away
If you ain’t no got the guts, trust
It’ll all become yesterday anyway so what’s the use?
I wanted to become happy and strong but why am I getting weaker?
Where am I going? I’m going here and there but I always come back here
Yeah, I’ll probably flow somewhere, is there an end to this maze?

I have a long way to go but why am I running in place?
I scream out of frustration but the empty air echoes
I hope tomorrow will be different from today
I’m just wishing

[Pre-Chorus: Jimin]
Follow your dream like breaker
Even if it breaks down, oh better
Follow your dream like breaker
Even if it breaks down, don’t ever run backwards, never

[Chorus: Jimin, Jin]
Because the dawn right before the sun rises is the darkest
Even in the far future, never forget the you of right now
Wherever you are right now, you’re just taking a break
Don’t give up, you know
Don’t get too far away, tomorrow

[Bridge: J-Hope]
Tomorrow, keep walking, we’re too young to stop
Tomorrow, open the door, we see too much to shut the door
When the dark night passes, a bright morning will come
When tomorrow comes, the bright light will shine so don’t worry
This isn’t a stop but just a pause in your life for a break
Turn up your thumbs and press play so everyone can see

[Pre-Chorus: Jungkook]
Follow your dream like breaker
Even if it breaks down, oh better
Follow your dream like breaker
Even if it breaks down, don’t ever run backwards, never

[Chorus: Jungkook, Jimin]
Because the dawn right before the sun rises is the darkest
Even in the far future, never forget the you of right now
Wherever you are right now, you’re just taking a break
Don’t give up, you know
Don’t get too far away, tomorrow

[Post-Chorus: Jungkook]
Don’t get far away, tomorrow
Don’t get too far away, tomorrow

153,spine-breaker,"

[Intro: All, RM]
(La la la la la la la la la)
Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah
(La la la la la la la la la)
Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah
(La la la la la la la la la)
You know BTS is back!

[Verse 1: Suga]
With shoes worth a couple hundred, padded jacket worth a couple thousand
With a watch worth a couple hundred you feel good about yourself
Education goes over the hill and student identity goes over the hill too
The class system of the 21st century is divided into two
Those who have and those who haven’t
Those who wear the shoes and those who don’t
Those who have the clothes and those who don’t
And those who try hard to get those things
What’s going on? Are you falling behind on the trend?
You whined and complained to get it, did I strike a nerve?
In your padded jacket, your greed fills it up
Even after seeing your parents’ curved spines, you’re so coldhearted
You complain that all your friends have it and that they should buy it for you
(Ayo baby) stop being so immature
You won’t freeze just because you don’t have that jacket
Fill your head with good sense before it’s too late

[Chorus: V, Jungkook]
Wow, it feels good, putting on your dirty clothes
You’re something different, rockin, rollin, swaggin, swagger, wrong!
What is wrong with you? You’re crazy baby
That is what will suffocate your heart, dirty clothes

[Hook: (All), Jungkook, Jin, Jimin, RM]
(La la la la la la la la la)
You are a spine breaker
(La la la la la la la la la)
Your parent’s spine breaker
(La la la la la la la la la)
Some day, you’ll regret it
(La la la la la la la la la)
Those damn spine breakers

[Verse 2: RM]
What’s up, kid? You don’t know how good you have it these days
Maybe I’m crossing the line for butting in other people’s lives
Why do you keep saying those empty words?
I’m saying I’ll spend my own money that I received
You’ll only be satisfied if I spend my money like you spend yours
Please go take care of yourself
It’s about your life, if you were me, I wouldn’t say anything
Yeah, my jacket is really expensive and not pretty at all
(But I say) I really want it so what do I do?
Friends who are poorer than me have it too
(And I say) I have no choice but to buy it if I don’t wanna be an outcast
People my age are all like this
Yeah I dunno, yes I’m loco, is it no-no?
I know they ain’t cheap but they got mojos
But I do what I gotta do, I don’t break my parent’s spines
The true beaker is you, who is old and stuck in your room

[Chorus: V, Jungkook]
Wow, it feels good, putting on your dirty clothes
You’re something different, rockin, rollin, swaggin, swagger, wrong
What is wrong with you? You’re crazy baby
That is what will suffocate your heart, dirty clothes

[Bridge: J-Hope]
Dirty clothes for you, dirty clothes for me
Everyone experienced it before
Wearing expensive clothes and walking on the street, feeling good about yourself
Everyone looks smaller than me like I’m Gulliver
Whatever you wear, I understand but you’re too much
You’re gonna regret it
You can keep your swag on but how about your parents?
Fine, I won’t stop you but make a decision now

[Chorus: V, Jungkook]
Wow, it feels good, putting on your dirty clothes
You’re something different, rockin, rollin, swaggin, swagger, wrong!
What is wrong with you? You’re crazy baby
That is what will suffocate your heart, dirty clothes

[Hook: All, Jungkook, Jin, Jimin]
(La la la la la la la la la)
You are a spine breaker
(La la la la la la la la la)
Your parent’s spine breaker
(La la la la la la la la la)
Some day, you’ll regret it
(La la la la la la la la la)
Those damn spine breakers

156,danger,"

[Intro: RM]
You’re in danger
You’re in danger
You’re in danger
You’re in danger

[Verse 1: RM]
You treat me like this everyday
You only care about yourself like you are just you
I am just I, that’s your kind of formula
Does your phone work right? Really?
Am I really your boy friend? I’m sick of this!
Why are you holding back your expression of love like you put off your homework?
Is it like a business relationship for you? Or Do you hate me or what?
Don't don't dig it, don't don't
Please be more affectionate! I pray for it again today

[Verse 2: Jungkook]
We are like parallel lines. We are so different though we both are looking at the same place
You are the only one that I got inside but I feel like that I’m outside of you
Whenever I turn sulky you ask me, “Are you mad at me?”
Have you ever really done something to me?
You are a sweetie! But I’m just a poor boy
I wish the miracle would happen that you love more than I do

[Pre-Chorus: Jin, Jimin]
You don’t have me inside but I’m full of you. It drives me crazy
But why are you doing this to me?
Why are you making a fool of me? Now I’m warning you!
Don’t get me twisted!

[Chorus: Jungkook, Jimin]
Are you fucking kidding me? What am I to you?
Am I easy to you? Are you playing with me?
You are in danger now
Why are you testing me? Why are you testing me?
Don’t get me twisted

[Chorus: V, Jimin]
Are you fucking kidding me? What am I to you?
Am I easy to you? Are you playing with me?
You are in danger now
Why are you testing me? Why are you testing me?
Don’t get me twisted

[Post-Chorus: V, Jimin]
You hurt me so!
You hurt me so!
You hurt me so!
Don’t get me twisted
You are too bad to me!
You are too bad to me!
You are too bad to me!
Don’t get me twisted

[Verse 3: J-Hope]
Contact. Absence. Unlock. Wanted
I’m searching for your real intention
You always send me just 1 or 2 line of text messages and that’s it
Was this really love I’ve wanted and dreamed?
Where is the love story filled with ups and downs?
Get soap opera heroes and heroines out of my way!
I am tearing my hair out like hundreds of times
You are so calm and feel no guilty, and you kick my ass

[Verse 4: Suga]
What am I? What am I? What am I to you?
I always heard your news not from yourself but from your friends
Want you. Want you. Uh~ I want you
You are trickster. You are a criminal who shook my heart..
I had already wasted my heart even before it started to burn
My one-way proposes are waste of time
If I was not a lover but just a friend to you, maybe you would feel more comfortable. I’m such a love loser

[Pre-Chorus: Jin, Jimin]
You don’t have me inside but I’m full of you. It drives me crazy
But why are you doing this to me?
Why are you making a fool of me? Now I’m warning you!
Don’t get me twisted!

[Chorus: Jungkook, Jimin]
Are you fucking kidding me? What am I to you?
Am I easy to you? Are you playing with me?
You are in danger now
Why are you testing me? Why are you testing me?

Are you fucking kidding me? What am I to you?
Am I easy to you? Are you playing with me?
You are in danger now
Why are you testing me? Why are you testing me?

You hurt me so!
You hurt me so!
You hurt me so!
Don’t get me twisted
You are too bad to me!
You are too bad to me!
You are too bad to me!
Don’t get me twisted

[Bridge: J-Hope]
If you are and I are together, let’s go time
24 hours, if I could only be with you
I’d kiss you starting from the morning
Can’t forget to grab some brunch
I’d hold your hand and soak up the sun
It’s not over yet, in the middle of a beautiful night
I’ll confess to you, with the moon as our light
All of these things tell me
“If I have just one day, it’s possible”

[Chorus: Jungkook, Jin, Jimin & Jin]
Just one day, if I can be with you
Just one day, if I can hold your hands
Just one day, if I can be with you
Just one day (just one day)
If only we can be together

[Post-Chorus: V, Jimin, J-Hope, Jungkook]
(Do it do it do it)
I hope I can be with you for just one day
(Do it do it do it)
Having a party party with only you
(Do it do it do it)
I hope I can be with you for just one day
(Do it do it do it)
A party party with only you

[Outro: Jungkook, Jimin, RM]
Just one day, if I can be with you
Just one day, if I can hold your hands
Just one day, if I can be with you
Just one day (just one day)
If only we can be together

Can you please stay with me?

158,no-more-dream,"

[Pre-hook: RM]
Hey, what's your dream?
Hey, what’s your dream?
Hey, what's your dream?
Hey, is that your dream?

[Verse 1: Suga, RM, Jungkook]
I wanna big house, big cars & big rings
But in real, I don't have any big dreams
Haha I live an easy life
Even if I don’t dream, no one says anything to me
Everyone is thinking the same as me
When we were still young
I said I'll go to some university
Okay, mum, I'm going to the library

[Pre-Chorus: V, J-Hope]
What is you that you dreamed of?
Who do you see in your mirror, I gotta say
Go your own way
Even if you live a day
Do something
Put weakness away

[Verse 2: Jungkook]
Why don't you say anything? You don't want to study
You're too afraid to quit the school, right? See, you're getting ready for school
Grow up, don't just talk, You have a weak mind boy
(Stop!) ask yourself, when did you try hard

[Pre-hook: RM]
Hey, what’s your dream?
Hey, what’s your dream?
Hey, what's your dream?
Hey, is that your dream?

[Chorus: Jungkook, Jimin]
It’s a lie you're such a liar
See me, see me ya, you're hypocrite
Why are you telling me to go another way? Do well yourself!
Don't push others!
(La la la la la)
What’s you dream? What's your dream?
(La la la la la)
Is that your dream? Is that your dream?

[Verse 3: Suga]
Boring same day, every day repeats
Adults and parents tell us the same dream
Future job number one, public officials?
It's not a forced dream, a relief pitcher

[Verse 4: J-Hope]
Throw a fast ball on the after school studying
Disobey the hell like society pardon the dream
Ask yourself 'bout the profile of your dream
Become the subject of your own life, away from suppression

[Pre-Chorus: Jin, Jimin]
What is you that you dreamed of?
Who do you see in your mirror, I gotta say
Go your own way
Even if you live a day
Do something
Put weakness away

[Pre-hook: RM]
Hey, what's your dream?
Hey, what's your dream?
Hey, what's your dream?
Hey, is that your dream?

See me, see me ya, you're hypocrite
Why are you telling me to go another way? Do well yourself!
Don't push others!
(La la la la la)
What's you dream? What's your dream?
(La la la la la)
Is that your dream? Is that your dream?

[Bridge: RM, Suga, Jungkook]
Don't know how to live
Don't know how to fly
Don't know how to decide
Don't know how to dream now

Open, open, open your eyes again
Dance, dance, dance again
Dream, dream, dream again
Don't hesitate, don't hesitate, wassup!

[Chorus: Jungkook, RM]
It's a lie you're such a liar
See me, see me ya, you're hypocrite
Why are you telling me to go another way? Do well yourself!

[Outro: RM]
To all the youngsters without dreams

"
159,no,"

[Hook: RM]
A good house, a good car, will these things bring happiness?
In Seoul to the SKY, would your parents be happy?

[Verse 1: Jungkook]
Dream is gone, no time to breathe
School, house and PC room is all we have
We live the same life
And have to become number one
For us it's like a double spy between dream and reality

[Verse 2: Suga]
Who is the one who made us into study machines?
It's either number one or a failure
They trap us in borders, the adults
There’s no choice but to consent
Even if we think simply, it’s the survival of the fittest
Who do you think is the one who makes us step on even our close friends to climb up? What?

[Pre-Chorus: V, Jungkook]
Adults tell me that hardships are only momentary
To endure a little more, to do it later

[Chorus: All, Jungkook, Jimin]
Everybody say NO!
It's not going to work anymore
Don't be captured in others dreams
We roll (We roll) We roll (We roll) We roll

Everybody say NO!
It has to be now
We've done nothing yet
We roll (We roll) We roll (We roll) We roll

Everybody say NO!

[Hook: RM]
A good house, a good car, will these things bring happiness?
In Seoul to the SKY, would your parents be happy?

[Verse 3: J-Hope]
I want to eat and have fun, I want to tear my uniform
Make money, good money, but they already view me crookedly
My obscure bank account, my unhappiness is past its limit
A factory of sighs while studying, a continuous cycle

[Verse 4: RM]
Adults say that we have it so easy
They say I'm on my way to happiness
Then how do you explain my unhappiness?
There's no conversation topics other than studying
Outside, there are so many kids like me, living the life of a puppet
Who will take responsibility?

[Pre-Chorus: Jin]
Adults tell me that hardships are only momentary
To endure a little more, to do it later

[Chorus: All, Jungkook, Jimin]
Everybody say NO!
It's not going to work anymore
Don't be captured in others dreams
We roll (We roll) We roll (We roll) We roll

Everybody say NO!
It has to be now
We've done nothing yet
We roll (We roll) We roll (We roll) We roll

Everybody say NO!

[Outro]
Everybody say NO!
Everybody say NO!
Everybody say NO!
Everybody say NO!

H-here for my music
Whatever my haters
Say I’m real for my music
Real for my music
R-real for my music

[Verse 1: RM]
Runch Randa and Rapmon
Are both part of me
The envy of the aspiring rappers my age
You guys only see what
You want to see anyway
You foolish and young’ins
With short educations like capri pants
When you rap about love and affection
I rap about big things
Those smack-cracker dolls who are filled
With inferiority complexes
Talk smack about my sunglasses, my hairstyle, my name
It’s sad comedy of losers in reality
My rap smothers you
Making you suffocate
Head-scratching kids who say they hate the busy world of K-Pop
Pretending to be someone they’re not
I know you suck suck
Damn fan, the public, manias
Yeah I’m makin’ em mine
Big Hit and Bangtan Boys
Yeah I’m makin’ em shine
Hooligans who will bring the value of our name
I’ve never wanted a hole-in-one
Yeah bitch I wanna be the one
Not number one but the only one
Swag

[Chorus: Jungkook, Jimin, Jin, V, RM]
I don’t know you and you don’t know me
So please shut up
Don’t worry about me, I’m better than you
And will continue to be so
Where are all the friends who looked
Down on my since before? We on
This isn’t a joke
I’ll show you, I promise ya, we on

[Verse 2: Suga]
Oh oh my haters, talk more smack about me
Keyboard warriors, make some more effort
Yes, look down on me like that
It’s my hobby
To prove you wrong
Uh my skills become a controversy
It’s too early to draw a conclusion
I’m killa, Jack the Ripper
I’ll pierce you with my sharp tongue
I’m illa, even if I’m lazy
I’m busier than you, hit home?
The haters who looked down on me before my debut
You were filled with hip-hop
Pride but now you’re beneath me
Look carefully, I’m in the majors
Jealous? Hey chaser
I think it’s too much
For you to follow
Just stay there
These lyrics I wrote myself is a hand-lib
I graduated from being a trainee, celebrate
I’m a rap blackbelt
You’re just a green belt
There’s no growth, hey guys
Feel more inferior

[Chorus: Jungkook. Jimin, V, Jin, RM]
I don’t know you and you don’t know me
So please shut up
Don’t worry about me, I’m better than you

This is for all the
Kids who smirked at us
“Congratulations”, yeah right
You’re just saying that
For connections
If so, your senses have rot, cut them out
Uh now our level has changed
He knows and she knows
Everyone’s number one interest
It’s too early to be awed
Look out for my future
I’ll go toward the path of my
Success as much as you looked down on me

[Chorus: Jungkook. Jimin, V, Jin, RM]
I don’t know you and you don’t know me
So please shut up
Don’t worry about me, I’m better than you

161,if-i-ruled-the-world,"

[Intro: V & Jimin, Jungkook]
If I ruled the world I’d do it all
(Westside, westside, westside)
If I ruled the world I’d do it all
(Westside, westside, westside)

[Verse 1: RM]
If I ruled the world I’d have it all
All guys probably feel the same
When it comes to pretty girls, There’s no racism
European, Asian, Caucasian girls
(I have ‘em)
Call Rick Owens, Ann Demeulemeester
Alexander Wang and Shane Oliver
I’ll make them make
The Kim Namjoon Collection forever
The color of the clothes would be black
Now I’m finally pleased
Music, turn it up
I’d pick my nose out of boredom
So I’ll make a song and
Make everyone on earth sing it
The title of the song would be “Ae gu ga”
I’ll be buried under pretty girls as I watch TV
All girls of the world would want me, ready to die
Boys, bring me alcohol
Or you can just disappear
Anyway, this is my kingdom

[Chorus: V, V & Jimin, Jungkook, Jin]
If I ruled the world
I’d do it all (I’d do it all)
I said 1 for the money, 2 for the money
If I ruled the world
I’d do it all (I’d do it all)
I said 1 for the money, 2 for the money

Everybody say he-o-e-oh-oh!
Everybody say he-o-e-oh-oh!
Everybody say hey, ho! Hey-hey-ho!
I know it’s ridiculous
But I’m singing this childish song

[Verse 2: Suga]
If I ruled the world, sometimes, I dream
If I ruled the world, first I’ll hire a real estate agent
And buy a house to live in with my family
Yes, next I’ll awaken my savings
And buy a four-wheel drive, put in some gas
Even if it’s too much
I’ll get it with zero-interest discount
Stocks and gambling
I don’t wanna do things like that
I rule the world so why would I dream small?
Don’t ask me that because
I still want to do music with my BTS family
I will become the Kim Jung-Un of the hip-hop world
And put a ban on everything but our music
I know it’s an unreasonable dream but it’s my dream
Don’t make fun of me

[Chorus: V, V & Jimin, Jungkook, Jin]
If I ruled the world
I’d do it all (I’d do it all)
I said 1 for the money, 2 for the money
If I ruled the world
I’d do it all (I’d do it all)
I said 1 for the money, 2 for the money

Everybody say he-o-e-oh-oh!
Everybody say he-o-e-oh-oh!
Everybody say hey, ho! Hey-hey-ho!
I know it’s ridiculous
But I’m singing this childish song

[Verse 3: J-Hope]
Oh girl, where? Oh god, here!
All the girls of the world are in hope world, lined up
Even if I lightly spend all the money I want
Money is put into the goalpost called my wallet
I’ll fearlessly walk around the stage
Even if I don’t run, my mileage would still build up
I will soon gift myself with these dreams
I’ll shout with the name of BTS
If I ruled the world

[Chorus: V, V & Jimin, Jungkook, Jin]
If I ruled the world
I’d do it all (I’d do it all)
I said 1 for the money, 2 for the money
If I ruled the world
I’d do it all (I’d do it all)
I said 1 for the money, 2 for the money

Everybody say he-o-e-oh-oh!
Everybody say he-o-e-oh-oh!
Everybody say hey, ho! Hey-hey-ho!

[Outro: Jin, Jimin, V, Jungkook]
I know it’s ridiculous
But I’m singing this childish song

"
162,coffee,"

[Chorus: Jungkook]
Baby baby, you’re a caramel macchiato
Your scent is still sweet on my lips
Baby baby tonight
Yeah

[Verse 1: RM]
Girl, I debuted, that’s enough right?
I made a bet with the world on how much I’d succeed
My half-moon eye smile that I only showed you
I’m doing it again these days
My fans are curious
Oh and I don’t drink macchiatos
You know that I started drinking americanos because of you
When we dated, I wondered what kind of taste this was
But this cold and bitter aftertaste
Makes sense now that you’re not here girl
If I’m gonna get used to everything like this
I would choose the full-of-regrets, playing with fire
Our heartless promises
Countless mistakes and other wrongs
Our unspeakable and small wounds
The glass filled with memories is more bitter as I drink it
But I think I know why I keep drinking it
Why am I getting so sad that everyone lives this way?
Oh oh oh

[Chorus: Jungkook, V]
Baby baby, you’re a caramel macchiato
Your scent is still sweet on my lips
Baby baby tonight
Yeah yeah yeah

Baby baby, you were warmer than the scent of a cafe latte
Do you remember that feeling?
Baby baby tonight
Yeah

[Verse 2: Suga]
Baby tonight, have a good night
Our first text and phone call that
Was filled with awkward moments
Our highly anticipated first date
Why did I bite my nails? Why was I so nervous?
As time went by, we naturally developed into lovers
With those kinds of words
We checked each other’s feelings
Our first date was sweet like a caramel macchiato
Wherever we went, we wanted to go together
But as time went by
Those feelings went down like dripping down espresso
Uh, my insides ache for no reason, uh we used to be so good
Breaking up was like a bitter americano
My memories still go to that cafe

[Chorus: Jungkook, Jin]
Baby baby, you’re a caramel macchiato
Your scent is still sweet on my lips
Baby baby tonight
Yeah

Baby baby, you were warmer than the scent of a cafe latte
Do you remember that feeling?
Baby baby tonight

[Bridge: J-Hope]
1,2,3,4
The days when I used to be
Intoxicated with your scent all day
I remember we chose to break up
After promising our futures together
As I drink this minty coffee that you
Used to like, I think of you, rewind
A lot of time passed and these days
I sometimes miss you, I wonder why?

[Chorus: Jungkook, Jimin]
Baby baby, you’re a caramel macchiato
Your scent is still sweet on my lips
Baby baby tonight

Baby baby, you were warmer than the scent of a cafe latte
Do you remember that feeling?
Baby baby tonight

You gave me the courage to live

We met each other beyond all time
So now how do we do? Can we make it work?
This fragile love

[Verse 3: V]
The world moves faster than we thought
How we gonna change it?
We don’t know yet but for sure we will

[Pre-Chorus: Jimin and V]
(Eh) Love in our hearts, uh yeah
(Eh) slowly started to grow

[Chorus: Jimin, Jin , Jungkook , V]
I want to hold you one more time before you disappear
Ah, crystal flies high wherever it goes
Hey, there’s nothing else I want, I just want to feel a little more
Can I touch your heart？
I want to touch it but it keeps slipping through my fingers, someday, someday

[Verse 4: V and Jungkook]
Your little smile somehow hurts me
How can I be closer uh uh?
Why can’t I find an answer for this love?
How am I gonna find it? How?
Oh, let me know

Crystal snow only holds an ambiguous shape
I can't bear my story of unrequited love

Even though we are meant to be together
Now we can't choose the paint that colors us
Even the black breath
Even your thick white fog

Oh yeah, oh, crystal snow, crystal snow
Inside the white fog
Even though you pass through me and turn to water, you are still in my heart

I watch you shining and reflecting on every single sparkling thing
I’ll wait for you no matter where
I want to see you, even if you're pretending, please hold this hand

It’s too late, too late
I can’t live without you
Even if I‘m drying out, I try harder to reach you

[Verse 1: Suga]
But it’s no use, it’s a dream to be broken
I run and run, but I’m not getting anywhere
Just burn me out, yes
Keep pushing me away
This is a fool, crazy in love, chasing in circles

[Pre-Chorus: V]
Make me run
Make me run more
Let my feet rip apart with wounds
At least I can I smile when I see you

[Chorus]
I run, run, run
I can’t stop
Run, run, run again
I can’t help it
This is all I can do anyway
All I know is how to love you

Run, run, run again
It’s okay to fall
Run, run. Run, again
It’s okay to get hurt
I’m alright, even if I can’t have you
Pitiful destiny, point your finger at me

(Run)
Don’t tell me bye bye

You make me cry cry

Love is a lie lie
Don’t tell me, don’t tell me
Don’t tell me bye bye

Everyone says it’s over, but I can’t stop
Is this sweat or tear, I can’t really tell oh
My love stripped bare, the stormy winds
They make me run again, my heart beats again

Make me run
Make me run more
Let my feet rip apart with wounds
At least I can I smile when I see you

I run, run, run

I can’t help it
This is all I can do anyway
All I know is how to love you

Run, run, run again
It’s okay to fall
Run, run. Run, again
It’s okay to get hurt
I’m alright, even if I can’t have you
Pitiful destiny, point your finger at me

[Bridge: V, Jungkook, Jin]
Memories crumble like dried flower petals
At the tip of my fingers, under my feet
Right behind your back
I’m chasing butterflies, so lost in dreams
I follow your traces
Show me the way, please stop me
Let me breathe

[Chorus]
I run, run, run
I can’t stop
Run, run, run again
I can’t help it
This is all I can do anyway
All I know is how to love you

Run, run, run again
It’s okay to fall
Run, run. Run, again
It’s okay to get hurt
I’m alright, even if I can’t have you
Pitiful destiny, point your finger at me

Don’t try to disappear

Is it true Is it true
You You
You’re so beautiful, that I’m scared

[Jimin]
Untrue Untrue
You You You

[Refrain: Jungkook]
Will you stay by my side
Will you promise me
If I let go of your hand, you’ll fly away and break
I’m scared scared scared of that

[Jimin]
Will you stop time
If this moment passes
As though it hadn’t happened
I’m scared scared scared I’ll lose you

[Chorus: Jungkook]
Butterfly like a Butterfly
Just like a Butterfly bu butterfly

[V]
Butterfly like a butterfly
Just like a Butterfly bu butterfly

[Verse 2: Suga]
You’re just like a Butterfly
From afar, I steal glances; if we touch hands, will I lose you?
You shine in this pitch darkness that is the butterfly effect
Your light touches, I forget the reality at once

[Verse 3: J-Hope]
It’s like a wind that gently strokes me
It’s like a dust that gently drifts along
You’re there but for some reason, I can’t reach you, stop
You, who’s like a dream is a butterfly high to me

[Pre-Chorus: Jin]
Untrue Untrue
You You You

[Refrain: Jungkook]
Will you stay by my side
Will you promise me
If I let go of your hand, you’ll fly away and break
I’m scared scared scared of that

[V]
Will you stop time
If this moment passes
As though it hadn’t happened
I’m scared scared scared I’ll lose you

[Bridge: Rap Monster]
The small pieces guttered down darkly
From my heart, a barren noise
I don’t know if this is reality or a dream
My Kafka on the seaside
Don’t go to those woods over there
My heart is still shattering on you
(I just wanted to vaporize like this)
My love that is forever
It’s all FREE for you baby

[Refrain: Jungkook]
Will you stay by my side
Will you promise me
If I let go of your hand, you’ll fly away and break
I’m scared scared scared of that

[V]
Will you stop time
If this moment passes
As though it hadn’t happened
I’m scared scared scared I’ll lose you

[Chorus: Jimin]
Butterfly like a Butterfly
Just like a Butterfly bu butterfly

[Jin]
Butterfly like a butterfly
Just like a Butterfly bu butterfly

167,let-me-know,"

[Intro: V]
On top of this ending tune
I am standing here alone
Now tell me
That it’s over, let me know

[Verse 1: Suga]
Suddenly, rain wells up in my eyes
You well up, I see you even when I breathe
Love blooms like cherry blossoms but burns and becomes ashes
Hey girl I know, the conclusion you made by yourself
Your hand, your body, your body heat that was hotter than the equator
I’m still here, on repeat on top of the disappeared tune
I’m turning by myself on top of this music that has ended

[Refrain: V]
On top of this ending tune
I am standing here alone
Now tell me
That it’s over, let me know

[Chorus: Jungkook/V]
Girl let me know
Girl let me know
Although I already know everything is over
Just so no regrets are left behind

Girl let me know
Girl let me know
Girl let me know
Tell me something

I just wanna know
I just wanna know
My lingering feelings are trying to withstand the end
So please tell me something, girl let me know

[Verse 2: J-Hope]
The promises we made disappeared with the time we spent together
The dominos have fallen with our breakup
Like Juliet and Romeo
Did I like you too much?
The heat between me and you won’t cool down
Now I look back at the film with you
Too early to do anything by thinking of you
You took away my stars at night, my sun at day
Only leaving me with the darkness of a single cold cloud
If there are hellos, then there’s bound to be goodbyes? Never ever
I don’t care about that, I don’t want to stick to that
I’ll turn away, hypnotizing myself

[Refrain: V]
On top of this ending tune
I am standing here alone
Now tell me
That it’s over, let me know

[Chorus: Jin/Jimin]
Girl let me know
Girl let me know
Although I already know everything is over
Although you’re over me

Girl let me know
Girl let me know
Girl let me know
Tell me something

I just wanna know
I just wanna know
My lingering feelings are trying to withstand the end
So please tell me something, girl let me know

[Bridge: Rap Monster]
Maybe we’re all just a bunch of fools
Everyone lives with a love that has come to an end
It’s not that I still have feelings for you
I know we can’t work out
But why does it feel like I’m having indigestion?
As if my insides will explode, cries come up my throat, making me throw up
In my imagination, I fight with you, make up with you and understand you
Your hand gestures, your eyes, they are faded but not gone
Why won’t it go away?
Why won’t it go away?
Why won’t it go away?

[Chorus: Jungkook/V]
Girl let me know
Girl let me know
Although I already know everything is over
Although you’re over me

Girl let me know
Girl let me know
Girl let me know
Tell me something

I just wanna know
I just wanna know
My lingering feelings are trying to withstand the end
So please tell me something, girl let me know

[Outro: Jungkook]
Let me know

"
168,just-one-day,"

[Intro: Jungkook, RM]
Yeah yeah
Yeah just one, day one night

[Verse 1: Suga]
If only I had just one day
I want to peacefully fall asleep intoxicated with your sweet scent
If there’s a chance in my busy schedule
I want to put my body in your warm and deep eyes
I like that, your long, straight hair
Your breathtaking neck when you
Put it up and the strands that fall out
Wherever we go
My handbag is your waist
Yo ma honey
Whenever I see you I run out of breath like the streets of Myungdong
Our BGM is the sound of breathing
Your voice when you say my name
I wanna be locked in you and swim in you
I want to know you more, an explorer venturing through your deep forest of mystery
I appreciate the masterpiece that is you because your existence alone is art
I imagine this all night every day
Because it’s a meaningless dream anyway

[Chorus: Jungkook]
Just one day, if I can be with you
Just one day, if I can hold your hands
Just one day, if I can be with you
Just one day (just one day)
If only we can be together

[Post-Chorus: All, Jin, J-Hope, Jimin, V]
(Do it do it do it)
I hope I can be with you for just one day
(Do it do it do it)
Having a party party with only you
(Do it do it do it)
I hope I can be with you for just one day
(Do it do it do it)
A party party with only you

[Verse 2: V, RM]
If only I could do that, how nice would it be
If only we could go anywhere
To eat and watch a movie comfortably
I would do anything girl
I’m sorry
Maybe I’m too rational
But still, if you see me some day, smile
Maybe you resent me a little or no, a lot
I know, I couldn’t look at you more because of my dream
Then just give me one day
Even if it’s in my dream, just one day
Out of all those words I had to swallow
Because of the excuse of reality
I’ll pick one and tell it to you for sure
Let’s meet when the lilies bloom
And say goodbye when they wither
I didn’t think I’d get over you easily but
Is it selfish of me to hope you are the same?
I’m still lying, saying that it’s all for you
You are standing in the center of my life

[Chorus: Jungkook, V]
Just one day, if I can be with you
Just one day, if I can hold your hands
Just one day, if I can be with you
Just one day (just one day)

[Bridge: J-Hope]
If you are and I are together, let’s go time
24 hours, if I could only be with you
I’d kiss you starting from the morning
Can’t forget to grab some brunch
I’d hold your hand and soak up the sun
It’s not over yet, in the middle of a beautiful night
I’ll confess to you, with the moon as our light
All of these things tell me
“If I have just one day, it’s possible”

[Chorus: Jungkook, Jin, Jimin & Jin]
Just one day, if I can be with you
Just one day, if I can hold your hands
Just one day, if I can be with you
Just one day (just one day)
If only we can be together

[Post-Chorus: V, Jimin, J-Hope, Jungkook]
(Do it do it do it)
I hope I can be with you for just one day
(Do it do it do it)
Having a party party with only you
(Do it do it do it)
I hope I can be with you for just one day
(Do it do it do it)
A party party with only you

[Outro: Jungkook, Jimin, RM]
Just one day, if I can be with you
Just one day, if I can hold your hands
Just one day, if I can be with you
Just one day (just one day)
If only we can be together

Can you please stay with me?

170,spring-day,"

[Verse 1: RM, J-Hope]
Miss you
Saying this makes me miss you even more
Miss you
Even though I’m looking at your photo
Time’s so cruel, I hate us
Seeing each other for once is now so hard between us

[Verse 2: RM]
It’s all winter here, even in August
My heart is running on the time
Alone on the Snowpiercer
Wanna get to the other side of the earth, holding your hand
Wanna put an end to this winter
How much longing should we see snowing down
To have the days of spring, Friend

[Verse 3: Jimin, V]
Like the tiny dust, tiny dust floating in the air
Will I get to you a little faster
If I was the snow in the air

[Pre-Chorus 1: Jungkook, V]
Snowflakes fall down
And get farther away little by little
I miss you (I miss you)
I miss you (I miss you)
How long do I have to wait
And how many sleepless nights do I have to spend
To see you (to see you)
To meet you (to meet you)

[Chorus: Jungkook, Jin, J-Hope]
Passing by the edge of the cold winter
Until the days of spring
Until the days of flower blossoms
Please stay, please stay there a little longer

[Verse 4: Suga, Jimin]
Is it you who changed (Is it you who changed)
Or is it me (Or is it me)
I hate this moment, this time flowing by
We are changed you know
Just like everyone you know

[Verse 5: Suga, Jimin]
Yes I hate you, you left me
But I never stopped thinking about you, not even a day
Honestly I miss you, but I’ll erase you
'Cause it hurts less than to blame you

[Verse 6: Jin, Jimin]
I try to exhale you in pain
Like smoke, like white smoke
I say that I’ll erase you
But I can’t really let you go yet

[Pre-Chorus 1: Jungkook, V]
Snowflakes fall down
And get farther away little by little
I miss you (I miss you)
I miss you (I miss you)
How long do I have to wait
And how many sleepless nights do I have to spend
To see you (to see you)
To meet you (to meet you)

[Bridge: V, Jungkook]
You know it all
You’re my best friend
The morning will come again
No darkness, no season is eternal

[Pre-Chorus 2: Jimin, Jungkook, V]
Maybe it’s cherry blossoms
And this winter will be over
I miss you (I miss you)
I miss you (I miss you)
Wait a little bit, just a few more nights
I’ll be there to see you (I'll go there to meet you)
I’ll come for you (I'll come for you)

[Chorus: Jungkook, J-Hope, Jin ]
Passing by the edge of the cold winter
Until the days of spring
Until the days of flower blossoms
Please stay, please stay there a little longer

171,danger,"

[Intro: RM]
You’re in danger
You’re in danger
You’re in danger
You’re in danger

[Verse 1: RM]
You treat me like this everyday
You only care about yourself like you are just you
I am just I, that’s your kind of formula
Does your phone work right? Really?
Am I really your boy friend? I’m sick of this!
Why are you holding back your expression of love like you put off your homework?
Is it like a business relationship for you? Or Do you hate me or what?
Don't don't dig it, don't don't
Please be more affectionate! I pray for it again today

[Verse 2: Jungkook]
We are like parallel lines. We are so different though we both are looking at the same place
You are the only one that I got inside but I feel like that I’m outside of you
Whenever I turn sulky you ask me, “Are you mad at me?”
Have you ever really done something to me?
You are a sweetie! But I’m just a poor boy
I wish the miracle would happen that you love more than I do

[Pre-Chorus: Jin, Jimin]
You don’t have me inside but I’m full of you. It drives me crazy
But why are you doing this to me?
Why are you making a fool of me? Now I’m warning you!
Don’t get me twisted!

[Chorus: Jungkook, Jimin]
Are you fucking kidding me? What am I to you?
Am I easy to you? Are you playing with me?
You are in danger now
Why are you testing me? Why are you testing me?
Don’t get me twisted

[Chorus: V, Jimin]
Are you fucking kidding me? What am I to you?
Am I easy to you? Are you playing with me?
You are in danger now
Why are you testing me? Why are you testing me?
Don’t get me twisted

[Post-Chorus: V, Jimin]
You hurt me so!
You hurt me so!
You hurt me so!
Don’t get me twisted
You are too bad to me!
You are too bad to me!
You are too bad to me!
Don’t get me twisted

[Verse 3: J-Hope]
Contact. Absence. Unlock. Wanted
I’m searching for your real intention
You always send me just 1 or 2 line of text messages and that’s it
Was this really love I’ve wanted and dreamed?
Where is the love story filled with ups and downs?
Get soap opera heroes and heroines out of my way!
I am tearing my hair out like hundreds of times
You are so calm and feel no guilty, and you kick my ass

[Verse 4: Suga]
What am I? What am I? What am I to you?
I always heard your news not from yourself but from your friends
Want you. Want you. Uh~ I want you
You are trickster. You are a criminal who shook my heart..
I had already wasted my heart even before it started to burn
My one-way proposes are waste of time
If I was not a lover but just a friend to you, maybe you would feel more comfortable. I’m such a love loser

[Pre-Chorus: Jin, Jimin]
You don’t have me inside but I’m full of you. It drives me crazy
But why are you doing this to me?
Why are you making a fool of me? Now I’m warning you!
Don’t get me twisted!

[Chorus: Jungkook, Jimin]
Are you fucking kidding me? What am I to you?
Am I easy to you? Are you playing with me?
You are in danger now
Why are you testing me? Why are you testing me?
Don’t get me twisted

[Chorus: V, Jimin]
Are you fucking kidding me? What am I to you?
Am I easy to you? Are you playing with me?
You are in danger now
Why are you testing me? Why are you testing me?
Don’t get me twisted

[Post-Chorus: V, Jimin]
You hurt me so!
You hurt me so!
You hurt me so!
Don’t get me twisted
You are too bad to me!
You are too bad to me!
You are too bad to me!
Don’t get me twisted

You're my Miss Right, Miss Right
If I lose you, it’s a miss, right? Miss Right? (All Right)
You're my Miss Right, Miss Right
Girl you want my kiss, right? Miss Right (All Right)

[Verse 1: RM]
Your sexy mind and your sexy body
You were even born with sexy brain wrinkles
Just in jeans, a white tee and converse high tops
That makes me wanna party on your body
At the end of of your long, shiny hair
Your gentle hips sing
You’re like a forest, shining inside the city
With that unrealistic body, you embrace my reality
And I want you to be really really real for me
Sometimes like my mom, sometimes you’re my energy
I’m an honest guy
I’m so nice on the outside that my enemies can’t stop being honest
You’re so different from the normal people outside
That’s why you’re called the ideal type
Yeah, when I think of you, my heart grows cold
You’re my winter ocean, I want to walk by you

[Chorus: V, Jungkook]
Yes you’re my only girl, you’re the best
I want to know about your day, I want to become your sighs
Yes you’re my only girl, you’re the best
You’re someone who only exists in the movies

[Post-Chorus: V, Jungkook]
Even the weather is good, I think I’m perfect with you
Wanna walk together? Wanna walk together?
Even the weather is good, I think I’m perfect with you
You’re someone who only exists in novels
It’s you

[Verse 2: Suga]
How can a person be like this?
I start to feel like I’m the only one living in this world
You pass by my side
A sweet wind called you is blowing in my heart
Even if you don’t put on makeup
You’ll put on your perfume called Attraction
I never believed that there was a god
But now you make me believe because to me, you’re a goddess
Whether you’re young or old, whether you have a hidden child
I don’t care because I love you
If I’m with you, anywhere we go is a flower garden
Instead of holding designer bags, you hold my hand
Instead of jealousy and envy, you understand my nature
With you, I draw out my future
In between our couple shoes are a pair of baby sneakers

[Chorus: Jungkook, Jin, Jimin]
Yes you’re my only girl, you’re the best
I want to know about your day, I want to become your sighs
Yes you’re my only girl, you’re the best
You’re someone who only exists in the movies
It’s you

[Bridge: J-Hope, RM]
I think she has come, I’m in front of the person who shakes up my heart
I think I’m attracted to you like a magnet, right now
Your life, your heart, your face, your line
Like a piece of a puzzle, you fit into my ideal type
Oh god, I’m like the wind that is led by the weather that is you
You’re a flower, I’m a bee, I’m only going toward you

Yo
I told you many qualifications ’bout my MISS RIGHT
But why you’re my MISS RIGHT is... you are...
Just you

[Chorus: V, Jungkook & Jimin, Jin]
Yes you’re my only girl, you’re the best
I want to know about your day, I want to become your sighs
Yes you’re my only girl, you’re the best
You’re someone who only exists in the movies

[Post-Chorus: V, Jungkook, Jungkook & Jimin, Jimin]
Even the weather is good, I think I’m perfect with you
Wanna walk together? Wanna walk together?
Even the weather is good, I think I’m perfect with you
You’re someone who only exists in novels
It’s you

Fall Fall Fall, falling

[Verse 1: Suga]
Because of you, I’m becoming ruined
I wanna stop, I don’t want you anymore
I can’t do it, this sucks
Please don’t give me any excuses

[Verse 2: J-Hope]
You can’t do this to me
All of the things you said are like a mask
It hides the truth and rips me apart
It pierces me, I’m going crazy, I hate this
Take it all away, I hate you

[Verse 3: V, RM, Suga]
But you’re my everything (You’re my)
Everything (You’re my)
Everything (You’re my)
Please go away huh

I’m sorry (I hate you)
I love you (I hate you)
Forgive me

Why am I in love alone, why am I hurting alone

Why do I keep needing you when I know I’ll get hurt?

I need you girl, you’re beautiful
I need you girl, you’re so cold
I need you girl I need you girl
I need you girl I need you girl

[Verse 4: RM, V]
It goes round & round, why do I keep coming back
I go down & down, at this point, I’m just a fool
Whatever I do, I can’t help it
It’s definitely my heart, my feelings but why don’t they listen to me
I’m just talking to myself again, talking to myself again
I’m just talking to myself again, talking to myself again
You’re not saying anything, please, I’ll treat you well
But the sky is blue, the sky is blue

[Verse 5: Jin]
The sky is blue and the sun is shining
So my tears are even more noticeable
Why is it you? Why did it have to be you?
Why can’t I leave you?

[Chorus: Jungkook, Jimin, RM, Jungkook & RM]
I need you girl
Why am I in love alone, why am I hurting alone
I need you girl
Why do I keep needing you when I know I’ll get hurt?

I need you girl, you’re beautiful
I need you girl, you’re so cold
I need you girl I need you girl
I need you girl I need you girl

[Bridge: Jin, V, Jungkook, Jimin]
Girl, just tell me you wanna break up
Girl, just tell me it wasn’t love
I have no courage to say that
Give me my last gift
So I can’t ever go back to you

[Chorus: Jimin, Jungkook, RM, Jungkook & RM]
I need you girl
Why am I in love alone, why am I hurting alone
I need you girl
Why do I keep needing you when I know I’ll get hurt?

I need you girl, you’re beautiful
I need you girl, you’re so cold
I need you girl I need you girl
I need you girl I need you girl

You all work for me
Everyone copies me
Dope, dope, dope

[Verse 6: Rap Monster, Suga]
Given up on 3? Given up on 5??
I like the number 6, how about giving up on 6?
The media and adults say we don’t have willpower, condemning us like stocks
Why are they killing us before we can even try, enemy enemy enemy
Why are you hanging your head and accepting it already? energy energy energy
Don’t ever give up, you know you not lonely
Our dawn is prettier than the day
So can I get a little bit of hope yeah
Wake your sleeping youth, go

[Verse 7: V]
I worked all night, every day
While you were playing in the club
Differently from other guys
I don’t wanna say yes
I don’t wanna say yes

[Pre-Chorus 7: Jin]
Make some noise, all right
Till your body burns up, all night, all night
Cause we got fire fire
Higher higher
I gotta make it, I gotta make it
It’s sick

[Chorus]
I reject rejection
I was always too much
Everyone follow me
It’s sick

Reject rejection
You're all my slaves
Everyone follow me
It’s sick

[Bridge: Jimin, Jungkook]
This kind of thing is BTS Style
Different from those lying wack jobs
Every day is hustle life
I gotta make it fire baby

This kind of thing is BTS style
Different from those lying wack jobs
Every day is hustle life
I gotta make it
I gotta make it
I’m kinda awesome

[Chorus]
Say what! (god dammit)
Say wo~ wo~
Say what!

[Intro: RM]
You’re in danger
You’re in danger
You’re in danger
You’re in danger

[Verse 1: RM]
You treat me like this everyday
You only care about yourself like you are just you
I am just I, that’s your kind of formula
Does your phone work right? Really?
Am I really your boy friend? I’m sick of this!
Why are you holding back your expression of love like you put off your homework?
Is it like a business relationship for you? Or Do you hate me or what?
Don't don't dig it, don't don't
Please be more affectionate! I pray for it again today

[Verse 2: Jungkook]
We are like parallel lines. We are so different though we both are looking at the same place
You are the only one that I got inside but I feel like that I’m outside of you
Whenever I turn sulky you ask me, “Are you mad at me?”
Have you ever really done something to me?
You are a sweetie! But I’m just a poor boy
I wish the miracle would happen that you love more than I do

[Pre-Chorus: Jin, Jimin]
You don’t have me inside but I’m full of you. It drives me crazy
But why are you doing this to me?
Why are you making a fool of me? Now I’m warning you!
Don’t get me twisted!

[Chorus: Jungkook, Jimin]
Are you fucking kidding me? What am I to you?
Am I easy to you? Are you playing with me?
You are in danger now
Why are you testing me? Why are you testing me?

[Chorus: V, Jimin]
Are you fucking kidding me? What am I to you?
Am I easy to you? Are you playing with me?
You are in danger now

You hurt me so!
You hurt me so!
You hurt me so!
Don’t get me twisted
You are too bad to me!
You are too bad to me!
You are too bad to me!
Don’t get me twisted

[Verse 3: J-Hope]
Contact. Absence. Unlock. Wanted
I’m searching for your real intention
You always send me just 1 or 2 line of text messages and that’s it
Was this really love I’ve wanted and dreamed?
Where is the love story filled with ups and downs?
Get soap opera heroes and heroines out of my way!
I am tearing my hair out like hundreds of times
You are so calm and feel no guilty, and you kick my ass

[Verse 4: Suga]
What am I? What am I? What am I to you?
I always heard your news not from yourself but from your friends
Want you. Want you. Uh~ I want you
You are trickster. You are a criminal who shook my heart..
I had already wasted my heart even before it started to burn
My one-way proposes are waste of time
If I was not a lover but just a friend to you, maybe you would feel more comfortable. I’m such a love loser

[Pre-Chorus: Jin, Jimin]
You don’t have me inside but I’m full of you. It drives me crazy

[Intro: RM, All]
You're my Miss Right, Miss Right
If I lose you, it’s a miss, right? Miss Right? (All Right)
You're my Miss Right, Miss Right
Girl you want my kiss, right? Miss Right (All Right)

[Verse 1: RM]
Your sexy mind and your sexy body
You were even born with sexy brain wrinkles
Just in jeans, a white tee and converse high tops
That makes me wanna party on your body
At the end of of your long, shiny hair
Your gentle hips sing
You’re like a forest, shining inside the city
With that unrealistic body, you embrace my reality
And I want you to be really really real for me
Sometimes like my mom, sometimes you’re my energy
I’m an honest guy
I’m so nice on the outside that my enemies can’t stop being honest
You’re so different from the normal people outside
That’s why you’re called the ideal type
Yeah, when I think of you, my heart grows cold
You’re my winter ocean, I want to walk by you

[Chorus: V, Jungkook]
Yes you’re my only girl, you’re the best
I want to know about your day, I want to become your sighs
Yes you’re my only girl, you’re the best
You’re someone who only exists in the movies

[Post-Chorus: V, Jungkook]
Even the weather is good, I think I’m perfect with you
Wanna walk together? Wanna walk together?
Even the weather is good, I think I’m perfect with you
You’re someone who only exists in novels
It’s you

[Verse 2: Suga]
How can a person be like this?
I start to feel like I’m the only one living in this world
You pass by my side
A sweet wind called you is blowing in my heart
Even if you don’t put on makeup
You’ll put on your perfume called Attraction
I never believed that there was a god
But now you make me believe because to me, you’re a goddess
Whether you’re young or old, whether you have a hidden child
I don’t care because I love you
If I’m with you, anywhere we go is a flower garden
Instead of holding designer bags, you hold my hand
Instead of jealousy and envy, you understand my nature
With you, I draw out my future
In between our couple shoes are a pair of baby sneakers

[Chorus: Jungkook, Jin, Jimin]
Yes you’re my only girl, you’re the best
I want to know about your day, I want to become your sighs
Yes you’re my only girl, you’re the best
You’re someone who only exists in the movies
It’s you

[Bridge: J-Hope, RM]
I think she has come, I’m in front of the person who shakes up my heart
I think I’m attracted to you like a magnet, right now
Your life, your heart, your face, your line
Like a piece of a puzzle, you fit into my ideal type
Oh god, I’m like the wind that is led by the weather that is you
You’re a flower, I’m a bee, I’m only going toward you

Yo
I told you many qualifications ’bout my MISS RIGHT
But why you’re my MISS RIGHT is... you are...
Just you

[Chorus: V, Jungkook & Jimin, Jin]
Yes you’re my only girl, you’re the best
I want to know about your day, I want to become your sighs
Yes you’re my only girl, you’re the best
You’re someone who only exists in the movies

[Post-Chorus: V, Jungkook, Jungkook & Jimin, Jimin]

[Intro: Jungkook, RM]
Yeah yeah
Yeah just one, day one night

[Verse 1: Suga]
If only I had just one day
I want to peacefully fall asleep intoxicated with your sweet scent
If there’s a chance in my busy schedule
I want to put my body in your warm and deep eyes
I like that, your long, straight hair
Your breathtaking neck when you
Put it up and the strands that fall out
Wherever we go
My handbag is your waist
Yo ma honey
Whenever I see you I run out of breath like the streets of Myungdong
Our BGM is the sound of breathing
Your voice when you say my name
I wanna be locked in you and swim in you
I want to know you more, an explorer venturing through your deep forest of mystery
I appreciate the masterpiece that is you because your existence alone is art
I imagine this all night every day
Because it’s a meaningless dream anyway

[Chorus: Jungkook]
Just one day, if I can be with you
Just one day, if I can hold your hands
Just one day, if I can be with you
Just one day (just one day)
If only we can be together

[Post-Chorus: All, Jin, J-Hope, Jimin, V]
(Do it do it do it)
I hope I can be with you for just one day
(Do it do it do it)
Having a party party with only you
(Do it do it do it)
I hope I can be with you for just one day
(Do it do it do it)
A party party with only you

[Verse 2: V, RM]
If only I could do that, how nice would it be
If only we could go anywhere
To eat and watch a movie comfortably
I would do anything girl
I’m sorry
Maybe I’m too rational
But still, if you see me some day, smile
Maybe you resent me a little or no, a lot
I know, I couldn’t look at you more because of my dream
Then just give me one day
Even if it’s in my dream, just one day
Out of all those words I had to swallow
Because of the excuse of reality
I’ll pick one and tell it to you for sure
Let’s meet when the lilies bloom
And say goodbye when they wither
I didn’t think I’d get over you easily but
Is it selfish of me to hope you are the same?
I’m still lying, saying that it’s all for you
You are standing in the center of my life

[Chorus: Jungkook, V]
Just one day, if I can be with you
Just one day, if I can hold your hands
Just one day, if I can be with you
Just one day (just one day)

[Bridge: J-Hope]
If you are and I are together, let’s go time
24 hours, if I could only be with you
I’d kiss you starting from the morning
Can’t forget to grab some brunch
I’d hold your hand and soak up the sun
It’s not over yet, in the middle of a beautiful night
I’ll confess to you, with the moon as our light
All of these things tell me
“If I have just one day, it’s possible”

[Chorus: Jungkook, Jin, Jimin & Jin]
Just one day, if I can be with you
Just one day, if I can hold your hands
Just one day, if I can be with you
Just one day (just one day)
If only we can be together

[Post-Chorus: V, Jimin, J-Hope, Jungkook]
(Do it do it do it)
I hope I can be with you for just one day
(Do it do it do it)
Having a party party with only you
(Do it do it do it)
I hope I can be with you for just one day
(Do it do it do it)
A party party with only you

[Outro: Jungkook, Jimin, RM]
Just one day, if I can be with you
Just one day, if I can hold your hands
Just one day, if I can be with you
Just one day (just one day)
If only we can be together

Can you please stay with me?

But in real, I don't have any big dreams
Haha I live an easy life
Even if I don’t dream, no one says anything to me
Everyone is thinking the same as me
When we were still young
I said I'll go to some university
Okay, mum, I'm going to the library

[Verse 1: Jungkook]
Dream is gone, no time to breathe
School, house and PC room is all we have
We live the same life
And have to become number one
For us it's like a double spy between dream and reality

[Verse 2: Suga]
Who is the one who made us into study machines?
It's either number one or a failure
They trap us in borders, the adults
There’s no choice but to consent
Even if we think simply, it’s the survival of the fittest
Who do you think is the one who makes us step on even our close friends to climb up? What?

[Pre-Chorus: V, Jungkook]
Adults tell me that hardships are only momentary
To endure a little more, to do it later

[Chorus: All, Jungkook, Jimin]
Everybody say NO!

I want to eat and have fun, I want to tear my uniform
Make money, good money, but they already view me crookedly
My obscure bank account, my unhappiness is past its limit
A factory of sighs while studying, a continuous cycle

[Verse 4: RM]
Adults say that we have it so easy
They say I'm on my way to happiness
Then how do you explain my unhappiness?
There's no conversation topics other than studying
Outside, there are so many kids like me, living the life of a puppet
Who will take responsibility?

To endure a little more, to do it later

Why are you testing me? Why are you testing me?
Don’t get me twisted

[Post-Chorus: V, Jimin]
You hurt me so!
You hurt me so!
You hurt me so!
Don’t get me twisted
You are too bad to me!
You are too bad to me!
You are too bad to me!
Don’t get me twisted

184,miss-right,"

[Intro: RM, All]
You're my Miss Right, Miss Right
If I lose you, it’s a miss, right? Miss Right? (All Right)
You're my Miss Right, Miss Right
Girl you want my kiss, right? Miss Right (All Right)

[Verse 1: RM]
Your sexy mind and your sexy body
You were even born with sexy brain wrinkles
Just in jeans, a white tee and converse high tops
That makes me wanna party on your body
At the end of of your long, shiny hair
Your gentle hips sing
You’re like a forest, shining inside the city
With that unrealistic body, you embrace my reality
And I want you to be really really real for me
Sometimes like my mom, sometimes you’re my energy
I’m an honest guy
I’m so nice on the outside that my enemies can’t stop being honest
You’re so different from the normal people outside
That’s why you’re called the ideal type
Yeah, when I think of you, my heart grows cold
You’re my winter ocean, I want to walk by you

[Chorus: V, Jungkook]
Yes you’re my only girl, you’re the best
I want to know about your day, I want to become your sighs
Yes you’re my only girl, you’re the best
You’re someone who only exists in the movies

[Post-Chorus: V, Jungkook]
Even the weather is good, I think I’m perfect with you
Wanna walk together? Wanna walk together?
Even the weather is good, I think I’m perfect with you
You’re someone who only exists in novels
It’s you

[Verse 2: Suga]
How can a person be like this?
I start to feel like I’m the only one living in this world
You pass by my side
A sweet wind called you is blowing in my heart
Even if you don’t put on makeup
You’ll put on your perfume called Attraction
I never believed that there was a god
But now you make me believe because to me, you’re a goddess
Whether you’re young or old, whether you have a hidden child
I don’t care because I love you
If I’m with you, anywhere we go is a flower garden
Instead of holding designer bags, you hold my hand
Instead of jealousy and envy, you understand my nature
With you, I draw out my future
In between our couple shoes are a pair of baby sneakers

[Chorus: Jungkook, Jin, Jimin]
Yes you’re my only girl, you’re the best
I want to know about your day, I want to become your sighs
Yes you’re my only girl, you’re the best
You’re someone who only exists in the movies
It’s you

[Bridge: J-Hope, RM]
I think she has come, I’m in front of the person who shakes up my heart
I think I’m attracted to you like a magnet, right now
Your life, your heart, your face, your line
Like a piece of a puzzle, you fit into my ideal type
Oh god, I’m like the wind that is led by the weather that is you
You’re a flower, I’m a bee, I’m only going toward you

Yo
I told you many qualifications ’bout my MISS RIGHT
But why you’re my MISS RIGHT is... you are...
Just you

[Chorus: V, Jungkook & Jimin, Jin]
Yes you’re my only girl, you’re the best
I want to know about your day, I want to become your sighs
Yes you’re my only girl, you’re the best
You’re someone who only exists in the movies

[Post-Chorus: V, Jungkook, Jungkook & Jimin, Jimin]
Even the weather is good, I think I’m perfect with you
Wanna walk together? Wanna walk together?
Even the weather is good, I think I’m perfect with you
You’re someone who only exists in novels
It’s you

[Intro: Jungkook]
Fall Fall Fall, scattering apart
Fall Fall Fall, falling

[Verse 1: Suga]
Because of you, I’m becoming ruined
I wanna stop, I don’t want you anymore
I can’t do it, this sucks
Please don’t give me any excuses

[Verse 2: J-Hope]
You can’t do this to me
All of the things you said are like a mask
It hides the truth and rips me apart
It pierces me, I’m going crazy, I hate this
Take it all away, I hate you

[Verse 3: V, RM, Suga]
But you’re my everything (You’re my)
Everything (You’re my)
Everything (You’re my)
Please go away huh

I’m sorry (I hate you)
I love you (I hate you)
Forgive me

[Chorus: Jimin, Jungkook, RM, Jungkook & RM]
I need you girl
Why am I in love alone, why am I hurting alone
I need you girl
Why do I keep needing you when I know I’ll get hurt?

I need you girl, you’re beautiful
I need you girl, you’re so cold
I need you girl I need you girl
I need you girl I need you girl

[Verse 4: RM, V]
It goes round & round, why do I keep coming back
I go down & down, at this point, I’m just a fool
Whatever I do, I can’t help it
It’s definitely my heart, my feelings but why don’t they listen to me
I’m just talking to myself again, talking to myself again
I’m just talking to myself again, talking to myself again
You’re not saying anything, please, I’ll treat you well
But the sky is blue, the sky is blue

[Verse 5: Jin]
The sky is blue and the sun is shining
So my tears are even more noticeable
Why is it you? Why did it have to be you?
Why can’t I leave you?

[Chorus: Jungkook, Jimin, RM, Jungkook & RM]
I need you girl
Why am I in love alone, why am I hurting alone
I need you girl
Why do I keep needing you when I know I’ll get hurt?

I need you girl, you’re beautiful
I need you girl, you’re so cold
I need you girl I need you girl
I need you girl I need you girl

[Bridge: Jin, V, Jungkook, Jimin]
Girl, just tell me you wanna break up
Girl, just tell me it wasn’t love
I have no courage to say that
Give me my last gift
So I can’t ever go back to you

[Chorus: Jimin, Jungkook, RM, Jungkook & RM]
I need you girl
Why am I in love alone, why am I hurting alone
I need you girl
Why do I keep needing you when I know I’ll get hurt?

I need you girl, you’re beautiful
I need you girl, you’re so cold
I need you girl I need you girl
I need you girl I need you girl

[Intro: Rap Monster]
Welcome, first time with BTS?

[Pre-Chorus 1: Jungkook]
Ayo ladies & gentleman
If you’re ready, I’ll start, yeah
Differently from the other guys
With my style with my style

[Pre-Chorus 2: Jimin]
I worked all night, everyday
While you were out clubbing
Don’t be surprised, listen every day
I got a feel, I got a feel

[Chorus]
I’m kinda sick

[Verse 1: J-Hope]
We're drenched, drenched, drenched
In sweat, in our practice room
Look, my great, great, great
Dance moves prove it all
All the weak, loser, whiny idiots
They have nothing on me
Cuz i'm full of hope haha

[Verse 2: Suga]
Ok we're dope from head to toe
Over half of the day, we drown in work
Even if our youth rots in the studio
Thanks to that, we're closer to success
Girls, shout louder
Make it ring, ring

[Pre-Chorus 1: V]
I worked all night, every day
While you were playing in the club
Differently from other guys
I don’t wanna say yes
I don’t wanna say yes

[Pre-Chorus 2: Jin/Jimin, Jungkook]
Make some noise, all right
Till your body burns up, all night (all night)
Cause we got fire (fire!)
Higher (higher!)
I gotta make it, I gotta make it
It’s sick

[Chorus: All]
I reject rejection
I'm always over the top
Everyone copies me
Dope, dope, dope, dope
I Reject rejection
You all work for me
Everyone copies me
Dope, dope, dope

[Verse 6: Rap Monster, Suga]
Given up on 3? Given up on 5??
I like the number 6, how about giving up on 6?
The media and adults say we don’t have willpower, condemning us like stocks
Why are they killing us before we can even try, enemy enemy enemy
Why are you hanging your head and accepting it already? energy energy energy
Don’t ever give up, you know you not lonely
Our dawn is prettier than the day
So can I get a little bit of hope yeah
Wake your sleeping youth, go

[Verse 7: V]
I worked all night, every day
While you were playing in the club
Differently from other guys
I don’t wanna say yes
I don’t wanna say yes

[Pre-Chorus 7: Jin]
Make some noise, all right
Till your body burns up, all night, all night
Cause we got fire fire

I gotta make it, I gotta make it
It’s sick

[Chorus]
I reject rejection
I was always too much
Everyone follow me
It’s sick

Reject rejection
You're all my slaves
Everyone follow me
It’s sick

[Bridge: Jimin, Jungkook]
This kind of thing is BTS Style
Different from those lying wack jobs
Every day is hustle life
I gotta make it fire baby

This kind of thing is BTS style
Different from those lying wack jobs
Every day is hustle life
I gotta make it
I gotta make it
I’m kinda awesome

[Chorus]
Say what! (god dammit)
Say wo~ wo~
Say what!
Dope

187,run,"

[Verse 1: Rap Monster]
You’re my sun, one and only in this world
I bloom for you, but you make me thirsty
It’s too late, too late
I can’t live without you
Even if I‘m drying out, I try harder to reach you

[Verse 1: Suga]
But it’s no use, it’s a dream to be broken
I run and run, but I’m not getting anywhere
Just burn me out, yes
Keep pushing me away
This is a fool, crazy in love, chasing in circles

[Pre-Chorus: V]
Make me run
Make me run more
Let my feet rip apart with wounds
At least I can I smile when I see you

[Chorus]
I run, run, run
I can’t stop
Run, run, run again
I can’t help it
This is all I can do anyway
All I know is how to love you

Run, run, run again
It’s okay to fall
Run, run. Run, again
It’s okay to get hurt
I’m alright, even if I can’t have you
Pitiful destiny, point your finger at me

(Run)
Don’t tell me bye bye
(Run)
You make me cry cry
(Run)
Love is a lie lie
Don’t tell me, don’t tell me
Don’t tell me bye bye

[Verse 3: J-Hope]
Everyone says it’s over, but I can’t stop
Is this sweat or tear, I can’t really tell oh
My love stripped bare, the stormy winds
They make me run again, my heart beats again

[Pre-Chorus: Jin]
Make me run
Make me run more
Let my feet rip apart with wounds
At least I can I smile when I see you

[Chorus]
I run, run, run
I can’t stop
Run, run, run again
I can’t help it
This is all I can do anyway
All I know is how to love you

Run, run, run again
It’s okay to fall
Run, run. Run, again
It’s okay to get hurt
I’m alright, even if I can’t have you
Pitiful destiny, point your finger at me

[Bridge: V, Jungkook, Jin]
Memories crumble like dried flower petals
At the tip of my fingers, under my feet
Right behind your back
I’m chasing butterflies, so lost in dreams
I follow your traces
Show me the way, please stop me
Let me breathe

[Chorus]
I run, run, run
I can’t stop
Run, run, run again
I can’t help it
This is all I can do anyway
All I know is how to love you

Run, run, run again
It’s okay to fall
Run, run. Run, again
It’s okay to get hurt
I’m alright, even if I can’t have you
Pitiful destiny, point your finger at me

(Run)
Don’t tell me bye bye
(Run)
You make me cry cry
(Run)
Love is a lie lie
Don’t tell me, don’t tell me
Don’t tell me bye bye

[Hook: Suga]
Burning up
Fire Fire Fire Fire

[Verse 1: J-Hope & Suga]
When I wake up in my room, I have nothing
After the sun sets, I sway as I walk
I’m completely drunk, drunk
I’m swearing on the streets
I’ve lost it, I’m like a crazy guy
Everything’s a mess, livin’ like beep

[Chorus: Jungkook & Jimin & Suga]
Live however you want, it’s yours anyway
Stop trying, it’s okay to lose
Errbody say La la la la la (La la la la la)
Say La la la la la (La la la la la)
Throw your hands up, scream, burn it up
Burning up

[Post-Chorus: V]
Set everything on fire, bow wow wow
Set everything on fire, bow wow wow

[Verse 2: Rap Monster & J-Hope]
Hey, burn it up
Like you’re gonna set everything on fire
Hey, turn it up
Until the dawn is gone
It's ok to just live because we're still young
Who do you think you are to say otherwise
Stop comparing, I'm just human
(So what~)

[Chorus: Jungkook & Jimin & Suga]
Live however you want, it’s yours anyway
Stop trying, it’s okay to lose
Errbody say La la la la la (La la la la la)

Throw your hands up, scream, burn it up
Burning up

Set everything on fire, bow wow wow

"
189,save-me,"

I want to breathe, I hate this night
I want to wake up, I hate this dream
I’m trapped inside of myself and I’m dead
Don’t wanna be lonely
Just wanna be yours

Why is it so dark where you’re not here
It’s dangerous how wrecked I am
Save me because I can’t get a grip on myself

Listen to my heartbeat
It calls you whenever it wants to
Because within this pitch black darkness
You are shining so brightly

Give me your hand
Save me save me
I need your love before
I fall, fall
Give me your hand save me save me
I need your love before I fall, fall

Give me your hand save me save me
Give me your hand save me save me

Save me, save me

Today the moon shines brighter on the blank spot in my memories
It swallowed me, this lunatic, please save me tonight
(Please save me tonight, please save me tonight)
Within this childish madness you will save me tonight

I knew that your salvation
Is a part of my life and the only helping hand that will embrace my pain
The best of me, you’re the only thing I have
Please raise your voice so that I can laugh again
Play on

Listen to my heartbeat, it calls you whenever it wants to
Because within this pitch black darkness, you are shining so brightly

Give me your hand save me save me
I need your love before I fall, fall
Give me your hand save me save me
I need your love before I fall, fall

Give me your hand save me save me
Give me your hand save me save me

Thank you for letting me be me
For helping me fly
For giving me wings
For straightening me out
For waking me from being suffocated
For waking me from a dream which was all I was living in
When I think of you the sun comes out
So I gave my sadness to the dog
(Thank you. For being ‘us’)

Give me your hand save me save me
I need your love before I fall, fall
Give me your hand save me save me
I need your love before I fall, fall

190,epilogue-young-forever,"

[Verse 1: Rap Monster]
The curtain falls and I’m out of breath
I get mixed feelings as I breathe out
Did I make any mistakes today
How did the audience seem
I’m happy with who I’ve become
That I can make someone scream with joy
Still excited from the performance

[Verse 2: Suga]
I stand on the empty stage while holding onto an aftertaste that will not linger for long
While standing on this empty stage, I become afraid of this unpleasant emptiness
Within my suffocating feelings
On top of my life’s line
Without a reason, I forcibly act that I am fine
This isn’t the first time, I better get used to it
I try to hide it, but I can’t
When the heat of the show cools down
I leave the empty seats behind

[Verse 3: J-hope]
Trying to comfort myself
I tell myself the world can’t be perfect
I start to let myself go
The thundering applause, I can’t own it forever
I tell myself, so shameless
Raise your voice higher
Even if the attention isn’t forever, I’ll keep singing
As today’s me, I want eternity
Forever, I want to be young

[Chorus: V]
Forever we are young

[Jungkook]
Under the flower petals raining down
I run, so lost in this maze

[V]
Forever we are young

[Jin]
Even when I fall and hurt myself
I endlessly run toward my dream

[Jimin (Suga)]
Forever ever ever ever
(dreams, hopes, forward, forward)

[V]
Forever ever ever ever
We are young

[Jimin (Rap Monster)]
Forever ever ever ever
(dreams, hopes, forward, forward)

[Jimin]
Forever ever ever ever
We are young

[Jungkook]
Forever we are young

[Jimin]
Under the flower petals raining down
I run, so lost in this maze

[V, Jimin]
Forever we are young

[Jin]
Even when I fall and hurt myself
I keep running toward my dream

[All, Jungkook, Jimin, V]
Forever we are young
Under the flower petals raining down
I run, so lost in this maze

Forever we are young
Even when I fall and hurt myself
I keep running toward my dream

[Pre-hook: RM]
Hey, what's your dream?
Hey, what’s your dream?
Hey, what's your dream?
Hey, is that your dream?

[Verse 1: Suga, RM, Jungkook]
I wanna big house, big cars & big rings
But in real, I don't have any big dreams
Haha I live an easy life
Even if I don’t dream, no one says anything to me
Everyone is thinking the same as me
When we were still young
I said I'll go to some university
Okay, mum, I'm going to the library

[Pre-Chorus: V, J-Hope]
What is you that you dreamed of?
Who do you see in your mirror, I gotta say
Go your own way
Even if you live a day
Do something
Put weakness away

[Verse 2: Jungkook]
Why don't you say anything? You don't want to study
You're too afraid to quit the school, right? See, you're getting ready for school
Grow up, don't just talk, You have a weak mind boy
(Stop!) ask yourself, when did you try hard

[Pre-hook: RM]
Hey, what’s your dream?
Hey, what’s your dream?
Hey, what's your dream?
Hey, is that your dream?

[Chorus: Jungkook, Jimin]
It’s a lie you're such a liar
See me, see me ya, you're hypocrite
Why are you telling me to go another way? Do well yourself!
Don't push others!
(La la la la la)
What’s you dream? What's your dream?
(La la la la la)
Is that your dream? Is that your dream?

[Verse 3: Suga]
Boring same day, every day repeats
Adults and parents tell us the same dream
Future job number one, public officials?
It's not a forced dream, a relief pitcher

[Verse 4: J-Hope]
Throw a fast ball on the after school studying
Disobey the hell like society pardon the dream
Ask yourself 'bout the profile of your dream
Become the subject of your own life, away from suppression

[Pre-Chorus: Jin, Jimin]
What is you that you dreamed of?
Who do you see in your mirror, I gotta say
Go your own way
Even if you live a day
Do something
Put weakness away

Hey, what's your dream?
Hey, what's your dream?
Hey, what's your dream?
Hey, is that your dream?

It's a lie you're such a liar
See me, see me ya, you're hypocrite
Why are you telling me to go another way? Do well yourself!
Don't push others!

What's you dream? What's your dream?
(La la la la la)
Is that your dream? Is that your dream?

[Bridge: RM, Suga, Jungkook]
Don't know how to live
Don't know how to fly
Don't know how to decide
Don't know how to dream now

Open, open, open your eyes again
Dance, dance, dance again
Dream, dream, dream again
Don't hesitate, don't hesitate, wassup!

[Chorus: Jungkook, RM]
It's a lie you're such a liar
See me, see me ya, you're hypocrite
Why are you telling me to go another way? Do well yourself!
Don't push others!

192,just-one-day,"

[Intro: Jungkook, RM]
Yeah yeah
Yeah just one, day one night

[Verse 1: Suga]
If only I had just one day
I want to peacefully fall asleep intoxicated with your sweet scent
If there’s a chance in my busy schedule
I want to put my body in your warm and deep eyes
I like that, your long, straight hair
Your breathtaking neck when you
Put it up and the strands that fall out
Wherever we go
My handbag is your waist
Yo ma honey
Whenever I see you I run out of breath like the streets of Myungdong
Our BGM is the sound of breathing
Your voice when you say my name
I wanna be locked in you and swim in you
I want to know you more, an explorer venturing through your deep forest of mystery
I appreciate the masterpiece that is you because your existence alone is art
I imagine this all night every day
Because it’s a meaningless dream anyway

[Chorus: Jungkook]
Just one day, if I can be with you
Just one day, if I can hold your hands
Just one day, if I can be with you
Just one day (just one day)
If only we can be together

[Post-Chorus: All, Jin, J-Hope, Jimin, V]
(Do it do it do it)
I hope I can be with you for just one day
(Do it do it do it)
Having a party party with only you
(Do it do it do it)
I hope I can be with you for just one day
(Do it do it do it)
A party party with only you

[Verse 2: V, RM]
If only I could do that, how nice would it be
If only we could go anywhere
To eat and watch a movie comfortably
I would do anything girl
I’m sorry
Maybe I’m too rational
But still, if you see me some day, smile
Maybe you resent me a little or no, a lot
I know, I couldn’t look at you more because of my dream
Then just give me one day
Even if it’s in my dream, just one day
Out of all those words I had to swallow
Because of the excuse of reality
I’ll pick one and tell it to you for sure
Let’s meet when the lilies bloom
And say goodbye when they wither
I didn’t think I’d get over you easily but
Is it selfish of me to hope you are the same?
I’m still lying, saying that it’s all for you
You are standing in the center of my life

[Chorus: Jungkook, V]
Just one day, if I can be with you
Just one day, if I can hold your hands
Just one day, if I can be with you
Just one day (just one day)

[Bridge: J-Hope]
If you are and I are together, let’s go time
24 hours, if I could only be with you
I’d kiss you starting from the morning
Can’t forget to grab some brunch
I’d hold your hand and soak up the sun
It’s not over yet, in the middle of a beautiful night
I’ll confess to you, with the moon as our light
All of these things tell me
“If I have just one day, it’s possible”

[Chorus: Jungkook, Jin, Jimin & Jin]
Just one day, if I can be with you
Just one day, if I can hold your hands
Just one day, if I can be with you
Just one day (just one day)
If only we can be together

[Post-Chorus: V, Jimin, J-Hope, Jungkook]
(Do it do it do it)
I hope I can be with you for just one day
(Do it do it do it)
Having a party party with only you
(Do it do it do it)
I hope I can be with you for just one day
(Do it do it do it)
A party party with only you

[Outro: Jungkook, Jimin, RM]
Just one day, if I can be with you
Just one day, if I can hold your hands
Just one day, if I can be with you
Just one day (just one day)
If only we can be together

Can you please stay with me?

193,danger,"

[Intro: RM]
You’re in danger
You’re in danger
You’re in danger
You’re in danger

[Verse 1: RM]
You treat me like this everyday
You only care about yourself like you are just you
I am just I, that’s your kind of formula
Does your phone work right? Really?
Am I really your boy friend? I’m sick of this!
Why are you holding back your expression of love like you put off your homework?
Is it like a business relationship for you? Or Do you hate me or what?
Don't don't dig it, don't don't
Please be more affectionate! I pray for it again today

[Verse 2: Jungkook]
We are like parallel lines. We are so different though we both are looking at the same place
You are the only one that I got inside but I feel like that I’m outside of you
Whenever I turn sulky you ask me, “Are you mad at me?”
Have you ever really done something to me?
You are a sweetie! But I’m just a poor boy
I wish the miracle would happen that you love more than I do

[Pre-Chorus: Jin, Jimin]
You don’t have me inside but I’m full of you. It drives me crazy
But why are you doing this to me?
Why are you making a fool of me? Now I’m warning you!
Don’t get me twisted!

[Chorus: Jungkook, Jimin]
Are you fucking kidding me? What am I to you?
Am I easy to you? Are you playing with me?
You are in danger now
Why are you testing me? Why are you testing me?
Don’t get me twisted

[Chorus: V, Jimin]
Are you fucking kidding me? What am I to you?
Am I easy to you? Are you playing with me?
You are in danger now
Why are you testing me? Why are you testing me?
Don’t get me twisted

[Post-Chorus: V, Jimin]
You hurt me so!
You hurt me so!
You hurt me so!
Don’t get me twisted
You are too bad to me!
You are too bad to me!
You are too bad to me!
Don’t get me twisted

[Verse 3: J-Hope]
Contact. Absence. Unlock. Wanted
I’m searching for your real intention
You always send me just 1 or 2 line of text messages and that’s it
Was this really love I’ve wanted and dreamed?
Where is the love story filled with ups and downs?
Get soap opera heroes and heroines out of my way!
I am tearing my hair out like hundreds of times
You are so calm and feel no guilty, and you kick my ass

[Verse 4: Suga]
What am I? What am I? What am I to you?
I always heard your news not from yourself but from your friends
Want you. Want you. Uh~ I want you
You are trickster. You are a criminal who shook my heart..
I had already wasted my heart even before it started to burn
My one-way proposes are waste of time
If I was not a lover but just a friend to you, maybe you would feel more comfortable. I’m such a love loser

[Pre-Chorus: Jin, Jimin]
You don’t have me inside but I’m full of you. It drives me crazy
But why are you doing this to me?
Why are you making a fool of me? Now I’m warning you!
Don’t get me twisted!

[Chorus: Jungkook, Jimin]
Are you fucking kidding me? What am I to you?
Am I easy to you? Are you playing with me?
You are in danger now
Why are you testing me? Why are you testing me?
Don’t get me twisted

[Chorus: V, Jimin]
Are you fucking kidding me? What am I to you?
Am I easy to you? Are you playing with me?
You are in danger now
Why are you testing me? Why are you testing me?
Don’t get me twisted

[Post-Chorus: V, Jimin]
You hurt me so!
You hurt me so!
You hurt me so!
Don’t get me twisted
You are too bad to me!
You are too bad to me!
You are too bad to me!
Don’t get me twisted

[Intro: Jungkook]
Fall Fall Fall, scattering apart
Fall Fall Fall, falling

[Verse 1: Suga]
Because of you, I’m becoming ruined
I wanna stop, I don’t want you anymore
I can’t do it, this sucks
Please don’t give me any excuses

[Verse 2: J-Hope]
You can’t do this to me
All of the things you said are like a mask
It hides the truth and rips me apart
It pierces me, I’m going crazy, I hate this
Take it all away, I hate you

[Verse 3: V, RM, Suga]
But you’re my everything (You’re my)
Everything (You’re my)
Everything (You’re my)
Please go away huh

I’m sorry (I hate you)
I love you (I hate you)
Forgive me

[Chorus: Jimin, Jungkook, RM, Jungkook & RM]
I need you girl
Why am I in love alone, why am I hurting alone
I need you girl
Why do I keep needing you when I know I’ll get hurt?

I need you girl, you’re beautiful
I need you girl, you’re so cold
I need you girl I need you girl
I need you girl I need you girl

[Verse 4: RM, V]
It goes round & round, why do I keep coming back
I go down & down, at this point, I’m just a fool
Whatever I do, I can’t help it
It’s definitely my heart, my feelings but why don’t they listen to me
I’m just talking to myself again, talking to myself again
I’m just talking to myself again, talking to myself again
You’re not saying anything, please, I’ll treat you well
But the sky is blue, the sky is blue

[Verse 5: Jin]
The sky is blue and the sun is shining
So my tears are even more noticeable
Why is it you? Why did it have to be you?
Why can’t I leave you?

[Chorus: Jungkook, Jimin, RM, Jungkook & RM]
I need you girl
Why am I in love alone, why am I hurting alone
I need you girl
Why do I keep needing you when I know I’ll get hurt?

I need you girl, you’re beautiful
I need you girl, you’re so cold
I need you girl I need you girl
I need you girl I need you girl

[Bridge: Jin, V, Jungkook, Jimin]
Girl, just tell me you wanna break up
Girl, just tell me it wasn’t love
I have no courage to say that
Give me my last gift
So I can’t ever go back to you

[Chorus: Jimin, Jungkook, RM, Jungkook & RM]
I need you girl
Why am I in love alone, why am I hurting alone
I need you girl
Why do I keep needing you when I know I’ll get hurt?

I need you girl, you’re beautiful
I need you girl, you’re so cold
I need you girl I need you girl
I need you girl I need you girl

195,dope,"

[Intro: Rap Monster]
Welcome, first time with BTS?

[Pre-Chorus 1: Jungkook]
Ayo ladies & gentleman
If you’re ready, I’ll start, yeah
Differently from the other guys
With my style with my style

[Pre-Chorus 2: Jimin]
I worked all night, everyday
While you were out clubbing
Don’t be surprised, listen every day
I got a feel, I got a feel

[Chorus]
I’m kinda sick

[Verse 1: J-Hope]
We're drenched, drenched, drenched
In sweat, in our practice room
Look, my great, great, great
Dance moves prove it all
All the weak, loser, whiny idiots
They have nothing on me
Cuz i'm full of hope haha

[Verse 2: Suga]
Ok we're dope from head to toe
Over half of the day, we drown in work
Even if our youth rots in the studio
Thanks to that, we're closer to success
Girls, shout louder
Make it ring, ring

[Pre-Chorus 1: V]
I worked all night, every day
While you were playing in the club
Differently from other guys
I don’t wanna say yes
I don’t wanna say yes

[Pre-Chorus 2: Jin/Jimin, Jungkook]
Make some noise, all right
Till your body burns up, all night (all night)
Cause we got fire (fire!)
Higher (higher!)
I gotta make it, I gotta make it
It’s sick

[Chorus: All]
I reject rejection
I'm always over the top
Everyone copies me
Dope, dope, dope, dope
I Reject rejection
You all work for me
Everyone copies me
Dope, dope, dope

[Verse 6: Rap Monster, Suga]
Given up on 3? Given up on 5??
I like the number 6, how about giving up on 6?
The media and adults say we don’t have willpower, condemning us like stocks
Why are they killing us before we can even try, enemy enemy enemy
Why are you hanging your head and accepting it already? energy energy energy
Don’t ever give up, you know you not lonely
Our dawn is prettier than the day
So can I get a little bit of hope yeah
Wake your sleeping youth, go

[Verse 7: V]
I worked all night, every day
While you were playing in the club
Differently from other guys
I don’t wanna say yes
I don’t wanna say yes

[Pre-Chorus 7: Jin]
Make some noise, all right
Till your body burns up, all night, all night
Cause we got fire fire
Higher higher
I gotta make it, I gotta make it
It’s sick

[Chorus]
I reject rejection
I was always too much
Everyone follow me
It’s sick

Reject rejection
You're all my slaves
Everyone follow me
It’s sick

[Bridge: Jimin, Jungkook]
This kind of thing is BTS Style
Different from those lying wack jobs
Every day is hustle life
I gotta make it fire baby

This kind of thing is BTS style
Different from those lying wack jobs
Every day is hustle life
I gotta make it
I gotta make it
I’m kinda awesome

[Chorus]
Say what! (god dammit)
Say wo~ wo~
Say what!
Dope

"
196,run,"

[Verse 1: Rap Monster]
You’re my sun, one and only in this world
I bloom for you, but you make me thirsty
It’s too late, too late
I can’t live without you
Even if I‘m drying out, I try harder to reach you

[Verse 1: Suga]
But it’s no use, it’s a dream to be broken
I run and run, but I’m not getting anywhere
Just burn me out, yes
Keep pushing me away
This is a fool, crazy in love, chasing in circles

[Pre-Chorus: V]
Make me run
Make me run more
Let my feet rip apart with wounds
At least I can I smile when I see you

[Chorus]
I run, run, run
I can’t stop
Run, run, run again
I can’t help it
This is all I can do anyway
All I know is how to love you

Run, run, run again
It’s okay to fall
Run, run. Run, again
It’s okay to get hurt
I’m alright, even if I can’t have you
Pitiful destiny, point your finger at me

(Run)
Don’t tell me bye bye
(Run)
You make me cry cry
(Run)
Love is a lie lie
Don’t tell me, don’t tell me
Don’t tell me bye bye

[Verse 3: J-Hope]
Everyone says it’s over, but I can’t stop
Is this sweat or tear, I can’t really tell oh
My love stripped bare, the stormy winds
They make me run again, my heart beats again

[Pre-Chorus: Jin]
Make me run
Make me run more
Let my feet rip apart with wounds
At least I can I smile when I see you

[Chorus]
I run, run, run
I can’t stop
Run, run, run again
I can’t help it
This is all I can do anyway
All I know is how to love you

Run, run, run again
It’s okay to fall
Run, run. Run, again
It’s okay to get hurt
I’m alright, even if I can’t have you
Pitiful destiny, point your finger at me

[Bridge: V, Jungkook, Jin]
Memories crumble like dried flower petals
At the tip of my fingers, under my feet
Right behind your back
I’m chasing butterflies, so lost in dreams
I follow your traces
Show me the way, please stop me
Let me breathe

[Chorus]
I run, run, run
I can’t stop
Run, run, run again
I can’t help it
This is all I can do anyway
All I know is how to love you

Run, run, run again
It’s okay to fall
Run, run. Run, again
It’s okay to get hurt
I’m alright, even if I can’t have you
Pitiful destiny, point your finger at me

(Run)
Don’t tell me bye bye
(Run)
You make me cry cry
(Run)
Love is a lie lie
Don’t tell me, don’t tell me
Don’t tell me bye bye

197,epilogue-young-forever,"

[Verse 1: Rap Monster]
The curtain falls and I’m out of breath
I get mixed feelings as I breathe out
Did I make any mistakes today
How did the audience seem
I’m happy with who I’ve become
That I can make someone scream with joy
Still excited from the performance

[Verse 2: Suga]
I stand on the empty stage while holding onto an aftertaste that will not linger for long
While standing on this empty stage, I become afraid of this unpleasant emptiness
Within my suffocating feelings
On top of my life’s line
Without a reason, I forcibly act that I am fine
This isn’t the first time, I better get used to it
I try to hide it, but I can’t
When the heat of the show cools down
I leave the empty seats behind

[Verse 3: J-hope]
Trying to comfort myself
I tell myself the world can’t be perfect
I start to let myself go
The thundering applause, I can’t own it forever
I tell myself, so shameless
Raise your voice higher
Even if the attention isn’t forever, I’ll keep singing
As today’s me, I want eternity
Forever, I want to be young

[Chorus: V]
Forever we are young

[Jungkook]
Under the flower petals raining down
I run, so lost in this maze

[V]
Forever we are young

[Jin]
Even when I fall and hurt myself
I endlessly run toward my dream

[Jimin (Suga)]
Forever ever ever ever
(dreams, hopes, forward, forward)

[V]
Forever ever ever ever
We are young

[Jimin (Rap Monster)]
Forever ever ever ever
(dreams, hopes, forward, forward)

[Jimin]
Forever ever ever ever
We are young

[Jungkook]
Forever we are young

[Jimin]
Under the flower petals raining down
I run, so lost in this maze

[V, Jimin]
Forever we are young

[Jin]
Even when I fall and hurt myself
I keep running toward my dream

[All, Jungkook, Jimin, V]
Forever we are young
Under the flower petals raining down
I run, so lost in this maze

Forever we are young
Even when I fall and hurt myself
I keep running toward my dream

"
198,save-me,"

I want to breathe, I hate this night
I want to wake up, I hate this dream
I’m trapped inside of myself and I’m dead
Don’t wanna be lonely
Just wanna be yours

Why is it so dark where you’re not here
It’s dangerous how wrecked I am
Save me because I can’t get a grip on myself

Listen to my heartbeat
It calls you whenever it wants to
Because within this pitch black darkness
You are shining so brightly

Give me your hand
Save me save me
I need your love before
I fall, fall
Give me your hand save me save me
I need your love before I fall, fall

Give me your hand save me save me
Give me your hand save me save me

Save me, save me

Today the moon shines brighter on the blank spot in my memories
It swallowed me, this lunatic, please save me tonight
(Please save me tonight, please save me tonight)
Within this childish madness you will save me tonight

I knew that your salvation
Is a part of my life and the only helping hand that will embrace my pain
The best of me, you’re the only thing I have
Please raise your voice so that I can laugh again
Play on

Listen to my heartbeat, it calls you whenever it wants to
Because within this pitch black darkness, you are shining so brightly

Give me your hand save me save me
I need your love before I fall, fall
Give me your hand save me save me
I need your love before I fall, fall

Give me your hand save me save me
Give me your hand save me save me

Thank you for letting me be me
For helping me fly
For giving me wings
For straightening me out
For waking me from being suffocated
For waking me from a dream which was all I was living in
When I think of you the sun comes out
So I gave my sadness to the dog
(Thank you. For being ‘us’)

Give me your hand save me save me
I need your love before I fall, fall
Give me your hand save me save me
I need your love before I fall, fall
