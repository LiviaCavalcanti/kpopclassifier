27,first-love,   the corner of my memory a brown piano settled on one side in the corner of my childhood house a brown piano settled on one side   i remember that moment way taller than my height the brown piano that guided me i looked up to you i yearned for you when i touched you with my small finger   i feel so nice mom i feel so nice i played the piano wherever my hands took me i didn’t know your significance back then back then i was content with just looking at you   i remember back during my elementary school days when my height became taller than yours i neglected you when i once yearned for you so on top of the white jadelike keyboard dust is piling on your image that has been neglected even then i didn’t know your significance no matter where i am you always defended that spot but i didn’t know that would be the last you say don’t leave like this   don’t worry even if i leave you’ll do well on your own i remember when i first met you before i knew it you grew up though we are putting an end to our relationship don’t ever feel sorry to me i will get to meet you again no matter what form greet me happily then   i remember back then when i met you that i had completely forgotten when i was around 14 the awkwardness was only for a moment i touched you again even though i was gone for a long time without repulsion you accepted me without you there’s nothing after the dawn two of us we welcomed the morning together don’t let go of my hand forever i won’t let go of you again either   i remember back then we burned up the last of my teen’s yes the days when we couldn’t see an inch in front of us we laughed we cried those days with you those moments are now in memories i said grasping my crushed shoulder i really can’t do any more every time i wanted to give up by my side you said bastard you can really do it yeah yeah i remember back then when i was fed up and lost back then when i fell into a pit of despair even when i pushed you away even when i resented meeting you you were firmly by my side you didn’t have to say anything so don’t ever let go of my hand i won’t let you go ever again either my birth and the end of my life you will be there to watch over it all   the corner of my memory a brown piano settled on one side in the corner of my childhood house a brown piano settled on one side  ,1,0.09,0.802,0.108,0.8743
28,reflection,   i know every life’s a movie we got different stars and stories we got different nights and mornings our scenarios ain’t just boring i find this movie very amusing everyday i want to shoot it well i want to caress myself i want to caress myself but you know sometimes i really really hate myself to be honest quite often i really hate myself when i really hate myself i go to dduksum i just stand there with the familiar darkness with the people that are smiling and beer which makes me smile coming to me softly fear which holds my hand it’s okay because everyone is in twos or threes it’s good that i have a friend too     the world is just another name for despair my height is just another diameter for the earth i am all of my joy and anxiety it repeats everyday the love and hate directed to me hey you who’s looking over the han river if we bump into each other while passing would it be fate or maybe we bumped into each other in our past life maybe we bumped into each other countless times in the darkness people look happier than the day everyone else knows where they’re supposed to be but only i walk without purpose but still blending in with them is more comfortable dduksum which has swallowed up the night hands me an entirely different world i want to be free i want to be free from freedom because right now i’m happy but i’m unhappy i’m looking at myself at dduksum     i wish i could love myself i wish i could love myself i wish i could love myself i wish i could love myself i wish i could love myself i wish i could love myself i wish i could love myself i wish i could love myself  ,1,0.104,0.538,0.358,0.9989
