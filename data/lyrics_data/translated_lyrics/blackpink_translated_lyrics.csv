[Intro: Jennie & Rosé]
Don’t go just stay
Let’s stop time now
If I’m with you
I could die in this moment
Forever young
Forever young
Forever young
Forever young

[Verse 1: Jisoo]
My reflection in your eyes
I hope it’s always like the day we met
Like the flames that burn without a sound
I hope you kiss me like it’s our last

[Verse 2: Rosé & Lisa]
Under the moonlight my heart is fluttering
Let’s go dance under the milky way let’s go
Right now let go
Let’s have no regrets when today has gone by
So that time can’t tear us apart
So that this moment can be eternal

[Pre-Chorus: Jennie & Rosé]
You light a fire in my heart
So that my youth without a regret is on fire
If I’m with you like now tonight
I could die in this moment

[Chorus: Jennie]
Forever young
Forever young
Forever young
Forever young

[Post-Chorus: Lisa]
Every every night night
I sing sing this song
Know we got that bomb bomb
Come again come again

[Verse 3: Jennie]
Forever young boy so we ride or die
You and I ride endlessly
Under the red sunset you are by my side
Pinked out or murdered out like it ain’t no thing
We need nothing, we are the protagonists
Say life’s a bish? But mine’s a movie
내 Diamond처럼 we’ll shine together
Whenever wherever forever ever ever

[Verse 4: Jisoo & Lisa]
Thrillingly, more dangerously
Will you go to the ends of the world, let’s go
Now let go
Let’s have no regrets when today has gone by
So that time can’t tear us apart
So that this moment can be eternal

[Pre-Chorus: Rosé & Jennie]
You light a fire in my heart
So that my youth without a regret is on fire
If I’m with you like now tonight
I could die in this moment

[Bridge: Rosé & Lisa]
Forever young (Blackpink is the Revolution)
When the moon rises and the stars rise, we dance body
Let’s ride endlessly, we like to party
When the moon rises and the stars rise, we dance body
Let’s ride endlessly, we like to party
Girls wanna have some fun
We go dumb dumb dumb
Girls wanna have some fun
What you want want want
Girls wanna have some fun
We go dumb dumb dumb
Girls wanna have some fun
We ain’t done done done

[Outro: Lisa]
Whatta bum bum whatta bum bum
Whatta bum bum whatta bum bum
Whatta bum bum whatta bum bum
Whatta bum bum whatta bum bum
Whatta bum bum whatta bum bum
Whatta bum bum whatta bum bum
Whatta bum bum whatta bum bum
Whatta bum bum whatta bum bum

"
1,really,"

[Chorus: Jennie & Rosé]
If you really really love me
I can not stand a day without you really really
I really want to stick with it really
If you really really want me
Really really
Really different from the other guy really

[Verse 1: Jisoo]
Tell me I'll take the stars in the sky
Good when you do not have a lot of time
Tell her to look at another girl's view
Sometimes I want a lie that does not sound like a lie

[Verse 2: Jennie]
A woman around you without a star
Stop and manage
You're coming to me anyway
Better act like you know what
Better act like you know what

[Pre-Chorus: Lisa]
Eyes have been callin me baby
Body been tellin me take me
Boys have been sayin to date me
Your lips should be sayin the same thing
For real what’s the deal got a feelin you feelin me
Aye but I don’t play with them fakes
Keep it real with me

[Chorus: Rosé & Jennie]
If you really really love me
I can not stand a day without you really really
I really want to stick with it really
If you really really want me
Really really
Really different from the other guy really

[Verse 3: Rosé]
I'll give you two if you give me one
No, no
If the two of you meet your eyes
I was lonely yesterday because of you no more

[Verse 4: Jisoo & Jennie]
Do not chew on me even if I drink alcohol yeah
Do not believe my words, it's over now yeah
It's not complicated. It's easy. 1, 2, 3
Imagine if we could be one

[Pre-Chorus: Lisa]
Want a romance like the old times
Want to slow dance when it's show time
Just me and you, and that slow jam
That playlist, my favorite, so play it, but baby
F a love song I need you to say it, say it

[Chorus: Jisoo & Rosé]
If you really really love me
I can not stand a day without you really really
I really want to stick with it really
If you really really want me
Really really
It's different from other men

[Outro: Lisa]
I gotta know that you’re for real
Really really really
I gotta know that you’re for real
Really really really
I gotta know that you’re for real
Really really really
I gotta know that you’re for real
Really really really

2,see-u-later,"

[JISOO]
There's nothing to worry about
I really did it
I do not like you anyway

[LISA]
Every time promises come back
Repeat countless times
I gave you all my heart so much, but no

[JENNIE]
Like an empty can Yes your sorry
Now the dog is barking
I looked up and started to think about everything

[ROSÉ]
I will throw you away
Next to her is a fool
I will tell you today I do not want you no more

[JENNIE]
Hold up Did you say you'll be eternal?
But the conclusion is that you messed up
You are a light ping pong
I'm kicking you now ding dong

[LISA]
Playa you is not know?
I picked the wrong person
He should have looked at me and gave it to me
Like queen bee

[JENNIE]

The pea pod was peeled off
It's useless to grab
That's it. That's it

[LISA]
Now you are not got no best friend
Lonely weekend
Yeah you loser lonely loser ha ha

[JENNIE]
Like an empty can Yes your sorry
Now the dog is barking
When I look up, I see all your faults

[ROSÉ]
I will throw you away
Next to her is a fool
I will tell you today I do not want you no more

[JENNIE]
As long as the pain was fast
You went to the hook now
I remember who I was
I'm a boss bish

[LISA]
You're right about that
I already erased your phone number
Boomin back to the heart of boomin
Pedal to the metal like

[JENNIE]
