0,love-dust,"

My friend talked about you
When he said you looked good, I got pointlessly angry
Maybe I still wanted you
To suffer because of me

These days, without knowing
I sing the songs we used to listen to together
On days like this when I’m locked in old memories
On nights when I miss you for no reason

I was too young back then
Love was hard so I tried to avoid you
It was too much pressure for me and so I was unhappy
So eventually, I made you cry

When today passes, you will disappear like dust –
What is love?
If I look sad, my tears are like smoke
Like dancing smoke

Tomorrow, my day will start like nothing is wrong
And I will forget you
I’ll just remain here, smiling
As I pray that you will be happy

Do you remember the day we first met?
Innocent smiles filled with Sauvignon Blanc
My submission to you without reason
Sometimes, our strong clashes
When separation became our fate-like reality
My last wrath

I hear stories from the radio
That I agree with
It’s exactly how I feel right now
I wonder if the story was sent by you as I fall asleep
Time passes so fast – I wonder if you’re doing well

I was too young back then
Love was hard so I tried to escape
Eventually it was too much pressure so I became unhappy
Although now it’s too late

When today passes, you will disappear like dust –
What is love?
If I look sad, my tears are like smoke
Like dancing smoke

Tomorrow, my day will start like nothing is wrong
And I will forget you
I’ll just remain here, smiling
As I pray that you will be happy

If we ever run into each other
On the streets
I hope we will look happy as we smile
Each with a different person
So long

When today passes, you will disappear like dust –
What is love?
If I look sad, my tears are like smoke
Like dancing smoke

Tomorrow, my day will start like nothing is wrong
And I will forget you
I’ll just remain here, smiling
As I pray that you will be happy

[Pre-Chorus: G-Dragon]
The winter had passed and the spring has come
We have withered and our hearts are bruised from longing

[Chorus: G-Dragon, Seungri]
(I’m singing my blues)
Used to the blue tears, blue sorrow
(I’m singing my blues)
The love that I have sent away with the floating clouds oh oh

[Verse 1: G-Dragon, Daesung]
Under the same sky, at different places
Because you and I are dangerous
I am leaving you, one letter difference from ‘nim’
It’s cowardly but I’m hiding because I’m not good enough
Cruel breakup is like the end of the road of love
No words can comfort me
Perhaps my lifetime’s last melodrama
Now its final curtain is coming down

I was born and I met you and I have loved you to death
My cold heart that has been dyed blue
Even with my eyes closed, I can’t feel you

[Pre-Chorus: Taeyang]
The winter had passed and the spring has come
We have withered and our hearts are bruised from longing

[Chorus: G-Dragon, Seungri]
(I’m singing my blues)
Used to the blue tears, blue sorrow
(I’m singing my blues)
The love that I have sent away with the floating clouds oh oh

[Verse 2: T.O.P, Taeyang]
I feel like my heart has stopped beating
You and I, frozen there, after a war
Trauma that has been carved in my head
Once these tears dry up, I will moistly remember my love
I’m neither painful nor lonely, happiness is all self-talk
I can’t stand something more complicated
It’s no big deal, I don’t care
Inevitable wandering, people come and go

I was born and I met you and I have loved you to death
My cold heart that has been dyed blue
Even if you have left, I’m still here

[Pre-Chorus: Daesung]
The winter had passed and the spring has come
We have withered and our hearts are bruised from longing

[Bridge: Taeyang]
Again tonight, underneath that blue moonlight
I will probably fall asleep alone
Even in my dreams, I look for you
And wander around while singing this song

[Chorus: G-Dragon, Seungri]
(I’m singing my blues)
Used to the blue tears, blue sorrow
(I’m singing my blues)
The love that I have sent away with the floating clouds oh oh
(I’m singing my blues)
Used to the blue tears, blue sorrow
(I’m singing my blues)
The love that I have sent away with the floating clouds oh oh

Ah...

Ayo choice, drop it on me

I was too harsh that night
I didn’t know you would really leave
The words, “I’m sorry”, is too difficult for us
That we take it to the end because I’m ill-tempered
We fight over stupid things numerous times a day
You take off crying, I look around and think
‘She’ll come back tomorrow
She’ll def call me first in the morning’

Baby, I can’t, I’m so bad that
I want to be good to you but it’s hard
Everyday and night I’m so mean
Cuz I’m so real so I’m sorry
(But I can’t change)

Me, whom you love, Sorry I’m a bad boy
Yes, just leave me, goodbye, you’re a good girl
The more time passes, the more you get to know me
Only disappointments will remain but

Baby don’t leave me
I know you still love me
Why, yes, I’ll tell you the truth, I need you
My lay lay lay lay lady
My lay lay lay lay lady

You’re different from normal boys, it’s so hard
You’re still so sensitive like a girl
Who is always smiling next to me, next to you I’m still too young
With the excuse that I’m busy, I postpone our date
Because I’m sorry, because I’m frustrated, I turn my head
The bride in my dreams is just a friend now
Upset over the breakup, we are silent

Baby, I can’t, I’m so bad that
I want to be good to you but it’s hard
Everyday and night I’m so mean

Today, on a day like this, she says
We should break up and she’s sorry – on our anniversary
Today, I am squeezed between many people
As I hang my head low, I try to avoid them (I hate myself for being this way)

Today, it’s okay, shout out louder yeah – good things will happen
It’s alright for tonight since it’s so beautiful so cry louder yeah
I will hug you, at this moment just fly high and jump
Woo hoo woo – right now

Today, when it gets really lonely, I get crazily sad
But no one understands, what to do?
Today, I think, why am I the only one who’s suffering like this?
Saying that everyone is happy are all lies – I won’t believe it – say 1, 2

Today, it’s okay, shout out louder yeah – good things will happen
It’s alright for tonight since it’s so beautiful so cry louder yeah
I will hug you, at this moment just fly high and jump

I will become a sad protagonist in this world
And I will hurt in place of you, I’ll become your wings
I believe you, I believe you
Believe in me, believe in me
Because everything will pass

11,blue,"

[Pre-Chorus: G-Dragon]
The winter had passed and the spring has come
We have withered and our hearts are bruised from longing

[Chorus: G-Dragon, Seungri]
(I’m singing my blues)
Used to the blue tears, blue sorrow
(I’m singing my blues)
The love that I have sent away with the floating clouds oh oh

[Verse 1: G-Dragon, Daesung]
Under the same sky, at different places
Because you and I are dangerous
I am leaving you, one letter difference from ‘nim’
It’s cowardly but I’m hiding because I’m not good enough
Cruel breakup is like the end of the road of love
No words can comfort me
Perhaps my lifetime’s last melodrama
Now its final curtain is coming down

I was born and I met you and I have loved you to death
My cold heart that has been dyed blue
Even with my eyes closed, I can’t feel you

[Pre-Chorus: Taeyang]
The winter had passed and the spring has come
We have withered and our hearts are bruised from longing

[Chorus: G-Dragon, Seungri]
(I’m singing my blues)
Used to the blue tears, blue sorrow
(I’m singing my blues)
The love that I have sent away with the floating clouds oh oh

[Verse 2: T.O.P, Taeyang]
I feel like my heart has stopped beating
You and I, frozen there, after a war
Trauma that has been carved in my head
Once these tears dry up, I will moistly remember my love
I’m neither painful nor lonely, happiness is all self-talk
I can’t stand something more complicated
It’s no big deal, I don’t care
Inevitable wandering, people come and go

I was born and I met you and I have loved you to death
My cold heart that has been dyed blue
Even if you have left, I’m still here

[Pre-Chorus: Daesung]
The winter had passed and the spring has come
We have withered and our hearts are bruised from longing

[Bridge: Taeyang]
Again tonight, underneath that blue moonlight
I will probably fall asleep alone
Even in my dreams, I look for you
And wander around while singing this song

[Chorus: G-Dragon, Seungri]
(I’m singing my blues)
Used to the blue tears, blue sorrow
(I’m singing my blues)
The love that I have sent away with the floating clouds oh oh
(I’m singing my blues)
Used to the blue tears, blue sorrow
(I’m singing my blues)
The love that I have sent away with the floating clouds oh oh

12,love-dust,"

My friend talked about you
When he said you looked good, I got pointlessly angry
Maybe I still wanted you
To suffer because of me

These days, without knowing
I sing the songs we used to listen to together
On days like this when I’m locked in old memories
On nights when I miss you for no reason

I was too young back then
Love was hard so I tried to avoid you
It was too much pressure for me and so I was unhappy
So eventually, I made you cry

When today passes, you will disappear like dust –
What is love?
If I look sad, my tears are like smoke
Like dancing smoke

Tomorrow, my day will start like nothing is wrong
And I will forget you
I’ll just remain here, smiling
As I pray that you will be happy

Do you remember the day we first met?
Innocent smiles filled with Sauvignon Blanc
My submission to you without reason
Sometimes, our strong clashes
When separation became our fate-like reality
My last wrath

I hear stories from the radio
That I agree with
It’s exactly how I feel right now
I wonder if the story was sent by you as I fall asleep
Time passes so fast – I wonder if you’re doing well

I was too young back then
Love was hard so I tried to escape
Eventually it was too much pressure so I became unhappy
Although now it’s too late

When today passes, you will disappear like dust –
What is love?
If I look sad, my tears are like smoke
Like dancing smoke

Tomorrow, my day will start like nothing is wrong
And I will forget you
I’ll just remain here, smiling
As I pray that you will be happy

If we ever run into each other
On the streets
I hope we will look happy as we smile
Each with a different person
So long

When today passes, you will disappear like dust –
What is love?
If I look sad, my tears are like smoke
Like dancing smoke

Tomorrow, my day will start like nothing is wrong
And I will forget you
I’ll just remain here, smiling
As I pray that you will be happy

Ah...
Baby come back...
Ayo choice, drop it on me

I was too harsh that night
I didn’t know you would really leave
The words, “I’m sorry”, is too difficult for us
That we take it to the end because I’m ill-tempered
We fight over stupid things numerous times a day
You take off crying, I look around and think
‘She’ll come back tomorrow
She’ll def call me first in the morning’

Baby, I can’t, I’m so bad that
I want to be good to you but it’s hard
Everyday and night I’m so mean
Cuz I’m so real so I’m sorry
(But I can’t change)

Me, whom you love, Sorry I’m a bad boy
Yes, just leave me, goodbye, you’re a good girl
The more time passes, the more you get to know me
Only disappointments will remain but

Baby don’t leave me
I know you still love me
Why, yes, I’ll tell you the truth, I need you
My lay lay lay lay lady
My lay lay lay lay lady

You’re different from normal boys, it’s so hard
You’re still so sensitive like a girl
Who is always smiling next to me, next to you I’m still too young
With the excuse that I’m busy, I postpone our date
Because I’m sorry, because I’m frustrated, I turn my head
The bride in my dreams is just a friend now
Upset over the breakup, we are silent

Baby, I can’t, I’m so bad that
I want to be good to you but it’s hard
Everyday and night I’m so mean
Cuz I’m so real so I’m sorry
(But I can’t change)

Me, whom you love, Sorry I’m a bad boy
Yes, just leave me, goodbye, you’re a good girl

Baby don’t leave me
I know you still love me
Why, yes, I’ll tell you the truth, I need you
My lay lay lay lay lady
My lay lay lay lay lady

Don’t say a thing
I act tough but I’m not inside
Don’t abandon me
You know that there’s no one
Who will understand me like you
Baby Oh you, come back to me ye ye ye

Me, whom you love, Sorry I’m a bad boy
Yes, just leave me, goodbye, you’re a good girl
The more time passes, the more you get to know me

When separation became our fate-like reality
My last wrath

I hear stories from the radio
That I agree with
It’s exactly how I feel right now
I wonder if the story was sent by you as I fall asleep
Time passes so fast – I wonder if you’re doing well

I was too young back then
Love was hard so I tried to escape
Eventually it was too much pressure so I became unhappy
Although now it’s too late

When today passes, you will disappear like dust –
What is love?
If I look sad, my tears are like smoke
Like dancing smoke

Tomorrow, my day will start like nothing is wrong
And I will forget you
I’ll just remain here, smiling
As I pray that you will be happy

If we ever run into each other
On the streets
I hope we will look happy as we smile
Each with a different person
So long

When today passes, you will disappear like dust –
What is love?
If I look sad, my tears are like smoke
Like dancing smoke

Tomorrow, my day will start like nothing is wrong
And I will forget you
I’ll just remain here, smiling
As I pray that you will be happy

23,bad-boy,"

Ah...
Baby come back...
Ayo choice, drop it on me

I was too harsh that night
I didn’t know you would really leave
The words, “I’m sorry”, is too difficult for us
That we take it to the end because I’m ill-tempered
We fight over stupid things numerous times a day
You take off crying, I look around and think
‘She’ll come back tomorrow
She’ll def call me first in the morning’

Baby, I can’t, I’m so bad that
I want to be good to you but it’s hard
Everyday and night I’m so mean
Cuz I’m so real so I’m sorry
(But I can’t change)

Me, whom you love, Sorry I’m a bad boy
Yes, just leave me, goodbye, you’re a good girl
The more time passes, the more you get to know me
Only disappointments will remain but

Baby don’t leave me
I know you still love me
Why, yes, I’ll tell you the truth, I need you
My lay lay lay lay lady
My lay lay lay lay lady

You’re different from normal boys, it’s so hard
You’re still so sensitive like a girl
Who is always smiling next to me, next to you I’m still too young
With the excuse that I’m busy, I postpone our date
Because I’m sorry, because I’m frustrated, I turn my head
The bride in my dreams is just a friend now
Upset over the breakup, we are silent

Baby, I can’t, I’m so bad that
I want to be good to you but it’s hard
Everyday and night I’m so mean
Cuz I’m so real so I’m sorry
(But I can’t change)

Me, whom you love, Sorry I’m a bad boy
Yes, just leave me, goodbye, you’re a good girl
The more time passes, the more you get to know me
Only disappointments will remain but

Baby don’t leave me
I know you still love me
Why, yes, I’ll tell you the truth, I need you
My lay lay lay lay lady
My lay lay lay lay lady

Don’t say a thing
I act tough but I’m not inside
Don’t abandon me
You know that there’s no one
Who will understand me like you
Baby Oh you, come back to me ye ye ye

Me, whom you love, Sorry I’m a bad boy
Yes, just leave me, goodbye, you’re a good girl
The more time passes, the more you get to know me
Only disappointments will remain but

Baby don’t leave me
I know you still love me
Why, yes, I’ll tell you the truth, I need you
My lay lay lay lay lady
My lay lay lay lay lady

Me, whom you love
Sorry I’m a bad boy
Sorry I’m a bad boy
Sorry I’m a bad boy

Yes, just leave me, good bye
You’re a good girl
You’re a good girl
You’re a good girl

Me, whom you love
Sorry I’m a bad boy
Sorry I’m a bad boy
Sorry I’m a bad boy

Yes, just leave me, good bye
You’re a good girl
You’re a good girl
You’re a good girl

24,wings,"

Today, on a day like this, she says
We should break up and she’s sorry – on our anniversary
Today, I am squeezed between many people
As I hang my head low, I try to avoid them (I hate myself for being this way)

Today, it’s okay, shout out louder yeah – good things will happen
It’s alright for tonight since it’s so beautiful so cry louder yeah
I will hug you, at this moment just fly high and jump
Woo hoo woo – right now

Today, when it gets really lonely, I get crazily sad
But no one understands, what to do?
Today, I think, why am I the only one who’s suffering like this?
Saying that everyone is happy are all lies – I won’t believe it – say 1, 2

Today, it’s okay, shout out louder yeah – good things will happen
It’s alright for tonight since it’s so beautiful so cry louder yeah
I will hug you, at this moment just fly high and jump

I will become a sad protagonist in this world
And I will hurt in place of you, I’ll become your wings
I believe you, I believe you
Believe in me, believe in me
Because everything will pass

Today, it’s okay, shout out louder yeah – good things will happen
It’s alright for tonight since it’s so beautiful so cry louder yeah
I will hug you, at this moment just fly high and jump

[Verse 1: G-Dragon]
It was so good back then
If only I was with you
Even though it was lonely and sad at times
If only I went through it with you
Sing it na na na
Sing it na na na
This isn’t the last time for us
Please, let’s meet again when the flowers bloom

[Verse 2: T.O.P]
Sometimes, so many weird things happen
Like you meeting a bad guy like me
Will I ever love again?
If it’s not you, I don’t think I can
When I was unconsciously just walking along wherever
You became my single ray of light, brightly shining on me
I feel the shivers on this pretty flower road
I was able to stand on it because of you, roly poly toy

[Pre-Chorus: Seungri]
If you are going to leave, I shall let you go
I shall scatter flowers on the path you will take

[Chorus: Taeyang]
If you miss me, come back to me
Then you can love me again
Go on this flower road and take a rest
Then wait for me at that place

[Verse 3: G-Dragon]
It was so good back then
If only I was with you
Even though it was lonely and sad at times
If only I went through it with you
I cried a lot but there were a lot of things to laugh about to
Inside my head, there are too many memories
This too shall pass
Let’s meet next time, when the flowers bloom

[Verse 4: T.O.P]
One year, 365 days, you’re my one and only in this world
My savior who gave me motive for my music
I leaned on your big flower garden and came up with lyrics
I still remember so clearly, padam padam
Your flower that is in full bloom has 100,000 colors
An infinite and great ring, like Vivaldi’s Four Seasons
You’re still a picture that I can’t even place in my heart
I’m doubting my eyes, you are my magical queen

[Pre-Chorus: Seungri]
If you are going to leave, I shall let you go
I shall scatter flowers on the path you will take

[Chorus: Daesung]
If you miss me, come back to me
Then you can love me again
Go on this flower road and take a rest
Then wait for me at that place

[Post-Chorus: Taeyang]
I’ll pick a flower and kiss you
Our faces growing red
I’ll make a flower road and prepare
For you to come to me

[Chorus: Seungri, Daesung]
If you miss me, come back to me
Then you can love me again
Go on this flower road and take a rest
Then wait for me at that place

[Post-Chorus: Taeyang]
I’ll pick a flower and kiss you
Our faces growing red
I’ll make a flower road and prepare it for you
So wait for me at that place
