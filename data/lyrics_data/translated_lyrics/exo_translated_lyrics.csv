[Verse 1: D.O, Baekhyun]
Contrary to how I feel, painful words come out
I made you struggle and I’m struggling too
Unlike my determination, nothing’s getting better
I always disappoint you and I regret it too

[Pre-Chorus: Suho, Kai, Chanyeol, Xiumin]
I don’t think I can forget you when the wind gets cold
The night our breaths touched with smoke coming out of our mouths
We warmly held each other with happy laughter
Nights we dreamed of a tomorrow that will shine like the stars

[Chorus: Chen, D.O]
I’ll search the universe
Until I can find you again
I won’t let go, even the smallest memories
Memories engraved in the seasons
They come and go several times
But I will still call out to you

[Verse 2: Chanyeol, Sehun, Chen, Kai]
Laughter and tears, scars and healing
Questions and answers, they’re all in you
You have my world, you’re my small universe
The moment it vanishes, I will disappear as well

[Chorus: Suho, Baekhyun]
I’ll search the universe
Until I can find you again
I won’t let go, even the smallest memories
Memories engraved in the seasons
They come and go several times
But I will still call out to you

[Bridge: D.O, Chen, Suho, Baekhyun]
Memories always bring tears
Where it was all washed away woo baby
Only you remain
These aren’t feelings that I can end
In just one day, with just one try
I feel it so much it hurts
Wherever you are, I’ll go to you

[Chorus: Xiumin, Chen, Baekhyun, D.O]
I’ll search the universe
Until I can find you again
I won’t let go, even the smallest memories
Memories engraved in the seasons
They come back so I will find you
Because that’s love
Because it’s love

"
3,been-through,"

I’ll get used to it, like catching a cold again
The ash gray light pushes through and endlessly passes by
But still

I must get through it
Cuz it’ll pass, it’ll pass
Just need a moment
Cuz it’ll pass, it’ll pass
Cuz it’ll pass, already

In the gray sky, there is a brighter light
Behind the dark clouds, there is a dazzling light

You shine like the stars
You light up my heart
At the end of today’s hardships
Brightly shine on me

Dadada Dadada Dum
Dadada Dadada Dum

Snap out of it, get up and brush it off
Pain is just a passing storm to me

I must get through it all
Cuz it’ll pass, it’ll pass
Just need a moment
Cuz it’ll pass, it’ll pass
Cuz it’ll pass, already

In the gray sky, there is a brighter light
Behind the dark clouds, there is a dazzling light

You shine like the stars
You light up my heart
At the end of today’s hardships
Brightly shine on me

This isn’t the end
Better days will come
At the end of that day
You’ll shine on me like this

The sun is behind the clouds that cover the light
Without change, you shine on me forever
The quiet air, the warm wind
They’re all there, always in the same place

In the gray sky, there is a brighter light
Behind the dark clouds, there is a dazzling light

You shine like the stars
You light up my heart
At the end of today’s hardships
Brightly shine on me

Brightly shine on me

"
4,stay,"

Hey, the warmth has scattered
The waves pushed me above this farewell
I’m placing the broken us
And throwing it far into the ocean

Hey, your empty spots
Make time stop
Why are you looking away?
That hurts me even more

Can’t believe, can’t believe
Your words, saying that love has stopped
Our memories have all crumbled down
I’m walking through your debris once again

Can’t believe, can’t believe
You’ve stopped like this
I thought we would last forever, but where are we?
In the end, I couldn’t ask you to stay

Hey, we’ve gone awry
Your name shines above black slumber
The deeper I fall into it
You get farther away like a vision

Hey, above my traces
You wash over again, erasing everything
Tell me this is a bad dream
To me, you’re a tragedy, a long one

Can’t believe, can’t believe
Your words, saying that love has stopped
Our memories have all crumbled down
I’m walking through your debris once again

Can’t believe, can’t believe
You’ve stopped like this
I thought we would last forever, but where are we?
In the end, I couldn’t ask you to stay

I can’t believe it, I won’t believe it, yeah
I can’t erase it all, I won’t erase it, yeah
You said let’s not forget even the smallest pieces
So I’m still here, keeping that promise baby
How you do that to me?
Baby how you do that to me?
I can’t believe this, our memories are killing me softly

I’m slipping above our break up, ripping apart from you
Two things remain with me, farewell and comfort
It’s all my fault
Cuz I couldn’t hold onto you or ask you to stay
Woo baby now how we doing?
We’ve really become strangers
Woo yeah, everything has disappeared but I can’t believe

Can’t believe, can’t believe
Your words, saying things’ll get better some day
To me, it’s already deep inside
The words I couldn’t say in the end, stay

Stay Stay
By my side

"
5,fall,"

Even time was lost in this place
Completely captivated by your light movements
I couldn’t stop you spreading inside of me
My eyes are only filled with you

I can’t even breathe (it’s not easy baby)
It gets deeper the more I try to escape

Just like this, fall, fall, fall for you
Into your swamp, fall, fall
I’m falling
Endlessly

My breath rises and locks
It’s actually more comfortable, deeper
Fall, Fall
I’m falling

The mixed up looks tie me up
You try to take over even my subconsciousness
I know it’s dangerous but I’m taking another step

I can’t even breathe (it’s not easy baby)
It gets thicker the more I try to escape

Just like this, fall, fall, fall for you
Into your swamp, fall, fall
I’m falling
Endlessly

My breath rises and locks
It’s actually more comfortable, deeper
Fall, Fall
I’m falling

In the faintly shining sky
Draw me out thicker (draw me out more)
For a long time in your memories (in your memories baby)
Engrave me deeper (engrave deeper)

Yeah, lies are bitter, even though I know, lies are bitter
I said I fell for you but you made me fall so deep
I can see endlessly, you come inside and suffocate me
I lost everything, can’t turn it back

I’m drinking in meaningless breaths
Tell me before the sun wakes up
Send yourself forever into my arms
Feels like I’m locked up every time I breathe

Just like this, fall, fall, fall for you
Into your arms, fall, fall
I’m falling
Endlessly

Feels so far away
Only you are allowed for me in this moment
Fall, fall, into you
I’m falling

"
6,good-night,"

When a night that is beautiful like you falls
In this sleepy world (I close my eyes) and quietly
Dream of you

Far away in the sky, the small stars
Shined wherever we walked
Into your ears, I whispered the love that I kept

Baby good night
The moment I drew you out in my dreams
I just wanted time to stop
I want you back in my arms
Still

I miss you
I can’t find you anywhere (you’re not here)
But this beautiful night comes back
Nothing is here, only the emptiness grows
Continuously

It’s so strange
I can’t see you (still)
But my time, my seasons
Keep going as if nothing’s wrong, yeah

When a night that is beautiful like you falls
In this sleepy world (I close my eyes) and quietly
Dream of you

Your eyes sparkled even brighter
Your voice was so soft
If only I could feel your touch just once more

Ooh, like a habit
Ooh, I think of you
Ooh

The stars in the night keep fading
Getting farther away like you and me
When morning comes, I forget about you
And I just wait for night to come back

I won’t give up baby
I’ll be waiting for you
A beautiful night without you
Comes to me again

I quietly close my eyes
And think of you
And without knowing, I fall asleep

"
7,lights-out,"

When even breathing feels hard
And tears rise up

Some times
You can hide in me and cry
You can do that
Because it’ll pass

Fall asleep in my arms
Don’t wake up
Morning will come again
So you can peacefully dream
At the end of this loneliness
Just turn off the lights today

When you lift your head
Smile for me
So you can forget your pain

So you can fall asleep
With the small but precious memories

Now you’re not alone
Don’t feel lonely anymore
Morning will come again
So you can peacefully smile
At the end of this sadness
Just turn off the lights today

Like the clouds covering the sky
If you get covered too
Then you, you
I’ll shine on you

Fall asleep in my arms
Don’t wake up
Morning will come again
So you can peacefully dream
At the end of this loneliness
Just turn off the lights today

"
8,the-eve,"

Look at me, what’s the situation
Past your flustered face
I see the walls crumbling down
And gradually, dawn is coming

It’s connecting endlessly
Can’t cut it off with this dull blade
So the problem keeps repeating
Like homework that can’t be solved

Fallen in front of a high wall
The small and weak sound of the wind
Gets entangled and turns into a storm
Listen to it

We must break it apart and clash against it
So we can see ourselves
We must shout out loud
So it spreads wide and far
The moment soft lights spread out
And chases away the darkness
We must wake up again
To the new morning

They look at me with arrogance
Already sitting at a different start line
The distance is far, yeah
As if our shouts won’t be heard

Countless and earnest dreams
That grew as they were trampled
Blossomed over the wall, confidently
Look at that scene

We must break it apart and clash against it
So we can see ourselves
We must shout out loud
So it spreads wide and far
The moment soft lights spread out
And chases away the darkness
We must wake up again
To the new morning

Distorted truths, the lies that were taught
A voice of change, a wave is rising
The one to create an ocean that will swallow it all
It’s you

We must break it apart and clash against it
So we can see ourselves
We must shout out loud
So it spreads wide and far
The moment soft lights spread out
And chases away the darkness
We must wake up again
To the new morning

9,chill,"Tonight, for no reason I feel strange, oh no A silhouette appears in the faint light Then my body hardens If not now I can’t ever escape from you I try running away with all my strength But I can’t What I do do do do do You’re beautiful that’s why I’m afraid A deep trap, you’re looking at me I’m already tied up And going to you When I see you, when I see you I keep getting chills I’m feeling something way more dangerous than love Coming right at me Your face is something between Expressionless and a child’s smile That risky difference of temperature Will I be able to handle you?
