9,trivia-seesaw,  it was a good start in itself before i knew it we were tired of each other in all of these meaningless emotions  repeated seesaw game im tired of this repeated seesaw game were getting tired of each other  were the petty arguments the start the moment i became heavier than you because theres never been parallels in the first place maybe i became more greedy and tried to fit in with you is there really a need to keep repeating ourselves saying this was love and this is love theyre tired of each other they seem to hold the same hand well then  alright a repeating seesaw game its about time we put an end to it all right this boring seesaw game somebody has to get out of here though neither of us can  dont let anyone know wholl get off first let’s not drag things out however our hearts lead us are we getting out of here or not this repeated seesaw game we have to stop it now  people can be so crafty they know they’ll get hurt if one person is missing because we dont want to be the villains in the midst of a series of vague responsibilities and we get so tired or if that we finally became parallel but we didn’t want this kind of parallel  at first we showed off who was heavier wed brag and smile now were trying to beat each other were in a competition the fire of a quarrel it’ll only end if someone gets off right here we’re acting like we’re comforting each other but it’s mixed with thorns can’t keep doing this we need to make a decision  if we didn’t have feelings for each other if we didn’t think of each other would we have dragged it out like this now if you don’t have any more feelings this seesaw is dangerous stop thinking about me  alright a repeating seesaw game its about time we put an end to it all right this boring seesaw game somebody has to get out of here though neither of us can   i walk on this seesaw without you  just like the beginning when you werent here  i walk on this seesaw without you  im getting off this seesaw without you  alright a repeating seesaw seesaw game its about time we put an end to it all right this boring seesaw game somebody has to get out of here though neither of us can  dont let anyone know wholl get off first let’s not drag things out however our hearts lead us are we getting out of here or not this repeated seesaw game we have to stop it now   i walk on this seesaw without you  just like the beginning when you werent here  i walk on this seesaw without you  im getting off this seesaw without you  ,1
10,tear,   goodbyes are for me a tear without even knowing it blooms around my eyes the words that i could not bring myself to say flow down and lingering regret crawls over my face to me you were once my dear but now you’re merely a bitter beer my heart that’s stained with belated selfloathing becomes empty even with the passing breeze at the end of my play where breakup was a lie the price that i had to pay came to me if someone said they would turn back the time for me would i have been able to be a bit more honest the bare face that only i know the ugly and pathetic old friends within me would you still be able to love me again like before with that smile with which you used look at me stop saying things like forever forever after all the end originally exists if there’s a start i don’t wanna listen to that words that are too correct or too much consolation i don’t wanna listen to that i was just so scared because it seemed like perhaps i had never loved you at all although it was late that you were true that only you loved me more   you’re my tear you’re my you’re my tear you’re my tear you’re my you’re my tear you’re my tear you’re my you’re my tear what more can i say you’re my tear   we walked towards the same place but this place becomes our last although we used to talk about forever now we break each other without mercy although we thought that we dreamed the same dream that dream has finally become a dream my heart is torn please burn it instead so that pain and regret none of that would be left   you’re my tear you’re my you’re my tear you’re my tear you’re my you’re my tear you’re my fear you’re my you’re my fear what more can i say you’re my   goodbyes are tear because things like tears are a luxury there’s no such thing as beautiful goodbyes so just begin now woo take it easy slowly carve out my heart that’s right that’s right gently step on the shards that have shattered so that regret regret such a thing will no longer be left please burn up my heart that was torn into shreds that’s right right there what are you hesitating for this is the ending you were wishing for so go on and kill me without hesitating woo yeah yeah burn it woo yeah yeah yeah burn it woo yeah yeah yeah burn it so not even the ashes remain   this is the real you and this is the real me now we’ve seen the end and not even resentment is left i’ve woken up from the sweet dream and i close my eyes this is the real you and this is the real me   we walked towards the same place but this place becomes our last although we used to talk about forever now we break each other without mercy although we thought that we dreamed the same dream that dream has finally become a dream my heart is torn please burn it instead so that pain and regret none of that would be left   you’re my tear you’re my you’re my tear you’re my tear you’re my you’re my tear you’re my fear you’re my you’re my fear what more can i say you’re my   what should i say we know the answer is fixed but replying is always hard   why are you spilling it why are you tearing it up it’s useless to me goodbye to me is only those moments  the moment you say words from your mouth the moment our focus becomes irregular at the moment where everything is dangerous our end that two letters handed to us that i won’t cry that i won’t tear it up i can’t say those kinds of words in the future i too breakup incurable disease you’re my beginning and my end that is all my meeting and my farewell you were everything step forward fear it will be repeated caused by you tear tear  ,1

52,moving-on,   ayo suga i remember how we came here three years ago when you and i used to fight all the time the wallpaper bathroom and veranda were all blue back then i thought this was a big place but my ambition grew too big that big house became too small now when the nine trainees shared a 17pyung house seems like it was just yesterday we grew up a lot good things were always other people’s things we were always hoarse from an uncertain future and worries seeing all the senior artists at the end of the year awards let’s not forget those things but put them away this place smells like us let’s not forget this scent wherever we are we cried a lot and laughed a lot but it was so beautiful nonhyeondong 3rd floor thank you   let’s move goodbye to this place that we grew attached to let’s move now to a higher place while taking the last box out of the empty room i looked back for a moment times we cried and laughed goodbye now   three years felt so short but so long a lot of things happened there were many memories i remember now that we’re about to leave traces of being used like bank accounts and credit cards as much as the place was small we were bound together tighter fight right here hitting each other sometimes maybe that’s why but we have good feelings and bad feelings of love too even the dust will be cleared now there’s more stuff than the beginning i have more than when i started too now let’s take our pride and go toward a bigger world with a bigger dream a new start a new beginning excited to see how it will become move the boxes hold your place wipe the dust after you’re done let’s get a bowl of black bean noodles that’s right   let’s move goodbye to this place that we grew attached to let’s move now to a higher place while taking the last box out of the empty room i looked back for a moment times we cried and laughed goodbye now   ever since i was born i counted the days for my first move i remember why i had to move the machine in my mom’s heart and the big scar in winter of 2010 at daegu the childish me used to measure the size of the world the reason why we moved into a business was because of all the bad things people said saying we follow money so moving left many things with me whether i liked it or not it changed a lot in my life my life was about paying rent i know i lived with my pride put into the down payment so i’m gonna move again i’m gonna have a dream a level higher than being an idol when will i stop having to move again i hope it comes quickly   let’s move goodbye to this place that we grew attached to let’s move now to a higher place while taking the last box out of the empty room i looked back for a moment times we cried and laughed goodbye now   let’s move goodbye to this place that we grew attached to let’s move now to a higher place while taking the last box out of the empty room i looked back for a moment times we cried and laughed goodbye now   everyone’s afraid of changes staying moving on staying moving on we keep repeating the same things again and again i guess that’s life i’m afraid old or new new or old that isn’t really important what’s important is that we still breathe and live in the same place so let’s move on  ,1
