2,three-out,"

You whined about how sick you were
So I brought you some medicine
But when I’m not there, you secretly went out
Are you kidding?
You are my silly boy
You got caught red-handed by my friend, stupid
I don’t need your excuses, stop it
Do whatever you want
Shut up shut up shut up

Three outs for you, out out out
Forever, bye bye bye
Are you regretting? Should’ve been good when you had me
I’m going to see another guy now
Happy, even without you
I’m gonna be happy, this is all for the better

You’re always like this, always trying to find the easy way out
It was up to me to let it go
Our relationship is no more
I hope you meet a girl like you, meet someone like you
Then you’ll realize, there’s no other girl like me

You pathetically begged me so I let it go once
But whenever you open your mouth, it’s all lies
(Are you kidding)
You are my nasty boy

I’m the fool for believing you, stupid
There is no forgiveness, stop it
Do whatever you want
Shut up shut up shut up

Three outs for you, out out out
Forever, bye bye bye
Are you regretting? Should’ve been good when you had me
I’m going to see another guy now
Happy, even without you
I’m gonna be happy, this is all for the better

There are no good memories
(No good memories)
I don’t ever wanna see you again, no regrets
Don’t look for me ever
(Anymore) Don’t shake me up
Please exit my heart

Three outs for you, out out out
Forever, bye bye bye
Are you regretting? Should’ve been good when you had me
I’m going to see another guy now
Happy, even without you
I’m gonna be happy, this is all for the better

Even when I think again, there’s no answer for you
I try to find a way but there is none
I can let it go once, twice and three times
Hey what are you talking about me

"

Ike the sun in the desert
Like the heat of midsummer

5,help-me,"

Where are you?
Who are you with?
I can’t get ahold of you
Don’t lie and say you’re working
You just can’t fix your habit
Even when I’m next to you, you seem nervous
Like you’re trying to avoid someone’s eyes
You don’t have to say it, I get a feeling
Are you thinking about something else?

No, no, I don’t want this
I don’t want to lose you

Because of you, my heart aches
Because of you, I can’t even sleep
Day by day, you ruin me
Don’t leave me alone anymore
Because of you, I cry every day
Because of you, I can’t even talk
I don’t want this anxious love anymore
Make me trust you

Help me help me
My love is in danger
Help me help me
What do I do?
Help me help me
You already know
Make me trust you

Why is your phone off every night?
Feels like you’re ignoring my calls
You say you’re sick
How much of that can I believe?
Every time, you lie
Every time, there’s anxiety and obsession
Because of you, because of this betrayal
All day, I’m covered with tears

Are you sick of us?
Or am I not good enough to you?
Be honest, don’t give excuses
I can see right through you

No, no, I don’t want this
I don’t want to lose you

Because of you, my heart aches
Because of you, I can’t even sleep
Day by day, you ruin me
Don’t leave me alone anymore
Because of you, I cry every day
Because of you, I can’t even talk
I don’t want this anxious love anymore
Make me trust you

Help me help me
My love is in danger
Help me help me
What do I do?
Help me help me
You already know
Make me trust you

I’m so curious, I’m going crazy
Like I’ve been hit, I can’t think of anything
Did I do something wrong?
Are you not attracted to me anymore?
I am already tamed by you
I can’t be with anyone else but you
I’m shaking, please give me assurance
Don’t torture me anymore

Because of you, my heart aches
Because of you, I can’t even sleep
Day by day, you ruin me
Don’t leave me alone anymore
Because of you, I cry every day
Because of you, I can’t even talk
I don’t want this anxious love anymore

6,oh-boy,"

Are you getting impatient?
Are you burning up?
You’re so anxious, so ridiculous
Oh boy, don’t be too nervous around me
One step, another step
You’re already ice
Don’t worry, trust me and follow me
Oh boy, just trust yourself to time

Surprise events are so typical, I don’t like them
If you’re gonna be like this, just follow me
Oh oh oh oh, get ready
Ok time to learn a lesson now

Oh boy oh boy, will you come to me slowly?
Trust even your breath with me
Oh boy oh boy, your face is like a child
So cute today

Drop it drop it drop it oh
Drop it drop it drop it oh
I’ll give you permission today
Oh boy oh boy, from today
You’re different, I’ll change you

Oh boy you know how we do
Eenie meenie miney mo
I know you do want some more
Half of them freeze when they see me
Risking their lives for Medusa’s head
Guys are indebted to me
They all bow down to me
Like trimming dead tree branches
I confidently walk and no one can stop me
Get out of my way

Sometimes, lies are more honest than the truth
Your lips have been imprisoned, now stop
Oh oh oh oh, get ready
Ok time to learn a lesson now

Oh boy oh boy, will you come to me slowly?
Trust even your breath with me
Oh boy oh boy, your face is like a child
So cute today

Drop it drop it drop it oh
Drop it drop it drop it oh
I’ll give you permission today
Oh boy oh boy, from today
You’re different, I’ll change you

Oh boy oh boy, will you come to me slowly?
Trust even your breath with me
Oh boy oh boy, your face is like a child
So cute today

Drop it drop it drop it oh
Drop it drop it drop it oh
I’ll give you permission today
Oh boy oh boy, from today
You’re different, I’ll change you

"
7,with-elvis,"

I can’t fall asleep easily
Will morning ever come?
I feel alone
The moment I looked down
I touched your shoulder
Since when was it?
Your shadow stood next to me
The moment my pitiful heart broken down
You smiled at me

Remember, you can lean on me
I’ll keep my small shoulder empty for you
Remember, I promise, always like this moment
I won’t change
Remember, you can cry next to me
For you, who always protected me
Without change, I’ll think of you today
And happily sing

I will go to you
Even when I’m tired and sick
You always embrace me
I can smile because of you
With you

Again today, at thoughts of you
I can’t easily fall asleep
All the times we spent together
I promise I won’t forget
Though you don’t say it, I can feel it
We are always together
You’re here next to me
I’m here next to you
I love you

Remember, you can lean on me
I’ll keep my small shoulder empty for you
Remember, I promise, always like this moment
I won’t change
Remember, you can cry next to me
For you, who always protected me
Without change, I’ll think of you today
And happily sing

All of the happy memories
All of the struggles we went through
They’re special
All of our remaining time
I hope they become precious memories
With you
