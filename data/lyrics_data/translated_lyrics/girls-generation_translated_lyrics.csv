With that spicy wood scent that I like
Mysteriously, I’m being pulled into you
All Night All Night All Night

It’s strange, feels like we’ve gotten closer
So many things happened between us

Drinking in the fever of the night
All Night All Night All Night

When you get into trouble

Woo, oh babe I know
Diving into you

Tonight, I cast a magic spell
So I could run through the night and go to you
The roads were dangerous and rough
But we met in the end
Woo, sometimes, when I’m trapped in darkness
When I can’t see ahead of me
You can be my guiding light
Only you were here for me

Look, when you’re struggling and tired
You can always lean on me

I wanna love you and hug you more
So I can be your greatest strength too

4,only-one,"

Only One Only One It’s you
Only One Only One It’s you

Do you remember that day? When we fought?
It’s not even a big deal now
Every day, you were by my side
So I guess I forgot how precious you are

Now I can look into your eyes
And feel your heart
Sometimes, I feel like I know you
Better than you do

If we’re together like we are now, only one, only one
If only you know, only one, only one
Me next to you, you next to me
No one can replace you, only one
Only One It’s you

Only One Only One It’s you
Only One Only One It’s you

Look back for a moment, for a long time
We walked on this rough path
And our hearts became stronger

Sometimes, we were far away
But you trusted me more than anyone else
Wherever we were, it was like we were together
Your heart reached mine

If we’re together like we are now, only one, only one
If only you know, only one, only one
Me next to you, you next to me
No one can replace you, only one
Only One It’s you

More than the past time
More than the past pain
Even if cold tears fall down
If I have you by my side, only one

If we’re together like we are now, only one, only one
If only you know, only one, only one
My heart looks at you, your heart protects me

If we’re together like we are now, only one, only one
If only you know, only one, only one
Me next to you, you next to me
No one can replace you, only one
Only One It’s you

Only One Only One It’s you

"
5,one-last-time,"

I asked how you were doing but there’s no answer
Your face looking at me has lost its scent
Only silence spreads and these moments exhaust me

Words that are in your eyes
Make me run out of breath, don’t wanna hear it
Stop time, don’t open your lips
Don’t let me lose you right now, yeah

In front of our break up, we’re strangers to each other
Try to think of the days we were in love
You can’t just let them go
For me, one last time

For you, one last time

My heart was always one step slower
If you wanted change, I wanted you to stay
But then, our footsteps stopped matching now

I want to hold onto your heart that is ending
Tears are falling, I’m afraid you’ll go far away
Stop time, hold tight to my hand
Let me stay in your arms

In front of our break up, we’re strangers to each other
Try to think of the days we were in love
You can’t just let them go
For me, one last time

One Last Time One Last Time

I know even if you don’t say it
Your heart will wear out and I will collapse
But before I break down and you lose me
Get ready once more
You and I, we’re in an ending season
I try to pull you in but you run away
All the days and nights we spent together
Don’t forget all of them

In front of our break up, we have stopped
I’m engraving the last image of you
So I can keep it for a long time
One Last Time (So give me one)

One Last Time (So give me one)
One Last Time (Give me one)
One Last Time
One Last Time

7,love-is-bitter,"

Like coffee that has cooled and lost its scent
Like a dry cookie that you can’t even take a bite of
Sweetness doesn’t last very long
Like the hot air that gets washed away in the summer rain

Because my love is always always bitter
Even if it repeats several times
Love is always always bitter
When black makeup smears around my eyes
The taste spreads in my heart
Even if it’s you, the end is always the same

You were like alluring champagne
Cuz I wanted to get drunk even if I regret it tomorrow
There’s no such thing as only sweetness
My greed has created
This bitter love chocolate

Because my love is always always bitter
Even if it repeats several times
Love is always always bitter
When the tears on my cheeks cry up
The taste spreads in my heart
Even if it’s you, the end is always the same

This familiar dejavu turns with the seasons
Chasing after illusions then left alone in the desert

Love is always always bitter
But I long for that deep embrace
Your eyes that looked at me after I awake
Your lips that touched mine
But when the curtains fall, it’s all in the past

Love is always bitter, oh I know that but

When black makeup smears around my eyes
The taste spreads in my heart
The end is bitter baby baby baby
Love is always bitter, love you, love you, baby

8,light-up-the-sky,"

Thinking ‘bout you
Where were you? I haven’t changed at all
After we got farther apart, it was really hard because I had to forget you
But time kept ticking, our memories faded too
Our hearts got farther apart but I can’t let it go
But let’s believe because our memories are still there

I have something to say to you
Will you listen?

Hold my hand once more, just one more time, it’ll be alright
We know each other the best in this world
Stay with me day and night
So only love can rise and bloom
And Light Up the Sky

The sky

Many things change in the world
But there are things that never change
It was foolish but I believed
That we would meet again

I don’t want to let you go again
I want to tell you

Come to me, just one more time, it’ll be alright
We know each other the best in this world
Stay with me day and night
So only love can rise and bloom
And Light Up the Sky

Will you be with me forever?
Will you stay by my side till the end of the world?
That’s what I’ll do until the end
So don’t leave me

Hold my hand once more, just one more time, it’ll be alright
We know each other the best in this world
Stay with me day and night
So only love can rise and bloom
And Light Up the Sky

(Don’t be afraid, my love)
Baby, Light Up the Sky
(Don’t be afraid, my love)
Baby, Light Up the Sky

12,tears,"

The white starlight, this black darkness
Is pushing me away from far
With a bright smile
Even just looking at you
I always become farther apart
When I call you
When I look for you
Come to me as the wind
Hug me in secret
So I can feel you
You are always next to me

The blue sky has dyed you
Before you find out about my love
Don’t feel bad for me
If you understand my tears
You will be able to laugh too

When I call you
When I look for you
Come to me as the sunshine
Make me shine with your bright smile
Even if I can’t feel you
You are always next to me

Love, this song
Do you hear it too?
Just like my eternal hope
You leave so many memories
I only think about you

When I call you
When I look for you
Come to me as the rainwater
Whisper to me under the umbrella
I loved you more
So I am hurting more

Lalalalalala lalalalalala
Lalalalalala lalalalalala

How can I convey it to you
My heart that really loved you
How is my love
Over there, like that
That love I will now

I love you
