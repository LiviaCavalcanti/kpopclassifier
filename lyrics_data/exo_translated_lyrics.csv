Your body is here, but your heart isn‘t
Come on tell me where you at
(Tell me, tell me, where you at)
Why don’t you tell me where you at
(Come on tell me where you at, at)

In the span of 14 seconds, you ‘ve become someone I don’t know
Come on tell me where you at
(Tell me, tell me, where you at)
Why don’t you tell me where you at
(Come on tell me where you at)

A beat that won‘t stop ringing, leaning on the dance floor no wall
Put your mouth near my ear and softly, screaming
Yelling out so that no one can hear, love’s words
Get caught up in the sound

Love gradually wants to climb up to the top, lips that get closer
It’s gonna be electric
Just enough so that they’re not touching
It’s gonna be electric
Oh baby, baby don’t close your eyes

Bounce Bounce wild heart
When the spark fly off bang
It’s gonna be electric
Down because of this numbing sensation
It’s gonna be electric
Oh baby, baby don’t touch me yet

I want to give you the worst kiss
Until you let that voice (anger?) out
Is it okay to tease you like this?
So electric, so electric yeah

Inside somebody, somebody, and someone’s circle
The tool makes a difference with other tools
Baby, baby what it is
Baby, baby what it is
On baby, baby what it is yeah
Because who gets to say who’s beside
What’s what, if you’re going to meddle badly
Put your foot out, put your hand out, too
Baby, baby what it is
Baby, baby what it is
On baby, baby what it is, yeah

A beat that won‘t stop ringing, leaning on the dance floor no wall
Put your mouth near my ear and softly, screaming

Let’s escape and go, get up
From this cramped town
And slip into the darkness

Love gradually wants to climb up to the top, lips that get closer
It’s gonna be electric
Just enough so that they’re not touching
It’s gonna be electric
Oh baby, baby don’t close your eyes

Bounce Bounce wild heart
When the spark fly off bang
It’s gonna be electric
Down because of this numbing sensation
It’s gonna be electric
Oh baby, baby don‘t touch me yet

I want to give you the worst kiss
Until you let that voice (anger?) out
Is it okay to tease you like this?
So electric, so electric yeah

2,universe,"

[Verse 1: D.O, Baekhyun]
Contrary to how I feel, painful words come out
I made you struggle and I’m struggling too
Unlike my determination, nothing’s getting better
I always disappoint you and I regret it too

[Pre-Chorus: Suho, Kai, Chanyeol, Xiumin]
I don’t think I can forget you when the wind gets cold
The night our breaths touched with smoke coming out of our mouths
We warmly held each other with happy laughter
Nights we dreamed of a tomorrow that will shine like the stars

[Chorus: Chen, D.O]
I’ll search the universe
Until I can find you again
I won’t let go, even the smallest memories
Memories engraved in the seasons
They come and go several times
But I will still call out to you

[Verse 2: Chanyeol, Sehun, Chen, Kai]
Laughter and tears, scars and healing
Questions and answers, they’re all in you
You have my world, you’re my small universe
The moment it vanishes, I will disappear as well

[Chorus: Suho, Baekhyun]
I’ll search the universe
Until I can find you again
I won’t let go, even the smallest memories
Memories engraved in the seasons
They come and go several times
But I will still call out to you

[Bridge: D.O, Chen, Suho, Baekhyun]
Memories always bring tears
Where it was all washed away woo baby
Only you remain
These aren’t feelings that I can end
In just one day, with just one try
I feel it so much it hurts
Wherever you are, I’ll go to you

[Chorus: Xiumin, Chen, Baekhyun, D.O]
I’ll search the universe
Until I can find you again
I won’t let go, even the smallest memories
Memories engraved in the seasons
They come back so I will find you
Because that’s love
Because it’s love

"
3,been-through,"

I’ll get used to it, like catching a cold again
The ash gray light pushes through and endlessly passes by
But still

I must get through it
Cuz it’ll pass, it’ll pass
Just need a moment
Cuz it’ll pass, it’ll pass
Cuz it’ll pass, already

In the gray sky, there is a brighter light
Behind the dark clouds, there is a dazzling light

You shine like the stars
You light up my heart
At the end of today’s hardships
Brightly shine on me

Dadada Dadada Dum
Dadada Dadada Dum

Snap out of it, get up and brush it off
Pain is just a passing storm to me

I must get through it all
Cuz it’ll pass, it’ll pass
Just need a moment
Cuz it’ll pass, it’ll pass
Cuz it’ll pass, already

In the gray sky, there is a brighter light
Behind the dark clouds, there is a dazzling light

You shine like the stars
You light up my heart
At the end of today’s hardships
Brightly shine on me

This isn’t the end
Better days will come
At the end of that day
You’ll shine on me like this

The sun is behind the clouds that cover the light
Without change, you shine on me forever
The quiet air, the warm wind
They’re all there, always in the same place

In the gray sky, there is a brighter light
Behind the dark clouds, there is a dazzling light

You shine like the stars
You light up my heart
At the end of today’s hardships
Brightly shine on me

Brightly shine on me

"
4,stay,"

Hey, the warmth has scattered
The waves pushed me above this farewell
I’m placing the broken us
And throwing it far into the ocean

Hey, your empty spots
Make time stop
Why are you looking away?
That hurts me even more

Can’t believe, can’t believe
Your words, saying that love has stopped
Our memories have all crumbled down
I’m walking through your debris once again

Can’t believe, can’t believe
You’ve stopped like this
I thought we would last forever, but where are we?
In the end, I couldn’t ask you to stay

Hey, we’ve gone awry
Your name shines above black slumber
The deeper I fall into it
You get farther away like a vision

Hey, above my traces
You wash over again, erasing everything
Tell me this is a bad dream
To me, you’re a tragedy, a long one

Can’t believe, can’t believe
Your words, saying that love has stopped
Our memories have all crumbled down
I’m walking through your debris once again

Can’t believe, can’t believe
You’ve stopped like this
I thought we would last forever, but where are we?
In the end, I couldn’t ask you to stay

I can’t believe it, I won’t believe it, yeah
I can’t erase it all, I won’t erase it, yeah
You said let’s not forget even the smallest pieces
So I’m still here, keeping that promise baby
How you do that to me?
Baby how you do that to me?
I can’t believe this, our memories are killing me softly

I’m slipping above our break up, ripping apart from you
Two things remain with me, farewell and comfort
It’s all my fault
Cuz I couldn’t hold onto you or ask you to stay
Woo baby now how we doing?
We’ve really become strangers
Woo yeah, everything has disappeared but I can’t believe

Can’t believe, can’t believe
Your words, saying things’ll get better some day
To me, it’s already deep inside
The words I couldn’t say in the end, stay

Stay Stay
By my side

"
5,fall,"

Even time was lost in this place
Completely captivated by your light movements
I couldn’t stop you spreading inside of me
My eyes are only filled with you

I can’t even breathe (it’s not easy baby)
It gets deeper the more I try to escape

Just like this, fall, fall, fall for you
Into your swamp, fall, fall
I’m falling
Endlessly

My breath rises and locks
It’s actually more comfortable, deeper
Fall, Fall
I’m falling

The mixed up looks tie me up
You try to take over even my subconsciousness
I know it’s dangerous but I’m taking another step

I can’t even breathe (it’s not easy baby)
It gets thicker the more I try to escape

Just like this, fall, fall, fall for you
Into your swamp, fall, fall
I’m falling
Endlessly

My breath rises and locks
It’s actually more comfortable, deeper
Fall, Fall
I’m falling

In the faintly shining sky
Draw me out thicker (draw me out more)
For a long time in your memories (in your memories baby)
Engrave me deeper (engrave deeper)

Yeah, lies are bitter, even though I know, lies are bitter
I said I fell for you but you made me fall so deep
I can see endlessly, you come inside and suffocate me
I lost everything, can’t turn it back

I’m drinking in meaningless breaths
Tell me before the sun wakes up
Send yourself forever into my arms
Feels like I’m locked up every time I breathe

Just like this, fall, fall, fall for you
Into your arms, fall, fall
I’m falling
Endlessly

Feels so far away
Only you are allowed for me in this moment
Fall, fall, into you
I’m falling

"
6,good-night,"

When a night that is beautiful like you falls
In this sleepy world (I close my eyes) and quietly
Dream of you

Far away in the sky, the small stars
Shined wherever we walked
Into your ears, I whispered the love that I kept

Baby good night
The moment I drew you out in my dreams
I just wanted time to stop
I want you back in my arms
Still

I miss you
I can’t find you anywhere (you’re not here)
But this beautiful night comes back
Nothing is here, only the emptiness grows
Continuously

It’s so strange
I can’t see you (still)
But my time, my seasons
Keep going as if nothing’s wrong, yeah

When a night that is beautiful like you falls
In this sleepy world (I close my eyes) and quietly
Dream of you

Your eyes sparkled even brighter
Your voice was so soft
If only I could feel your touch just once more

Ooh, like a habit
Ooh, I think of you
Ooh

The stars in the night keep fading
Getting farther away like you and me
When morning comes, I forget about you
And I just wait for night to come back

I won’t give up baby
I’ll be waiting for you
A beautiful night without you
Comes to me again

I quietly close my eyes
And think of you
And without knowing, I fall asleep

"
7,lights-out,"

When even breathing feels hard
And tears rise up

Some times
You can hide in me and cry
You can do that
Because it’ll pass

Fall asleep in my arms
Don’t wake up
Morning will come again
So you can peacefully dream
At the end of this loneliness
Just turn off the lights today

When you lift your head
Smile for me
So you can forget your pain

So you can fall asleep
With the small but precious memories

Now you’re not alone
Don’t feel lonely anymore
Morning will come again
So you can peacefully smile
At the end of this sadness
Just turn off the lights today

Like the clouds covering the sky
If you get covered too
Then you, you
I’ll shine on you

Fall asleep in my arms
Don’t wake up
Morning will come again
So you can peacefully dream
At the end of this loneliness
Just turn off the lights today

"
8,the-eve,"

Look at me, what’s the situation
Past your flustered face
I see the walls crumbling down
And gradually, dawn is coming

It’s connecting endlessly
Can’t cut it off with this dull blade
So the problem keeps repeating
Like homework that can’t be solved

Fallen in front of a high wall
The small and weak sound of the wind
Gets entangled and turns into a storm
Listen to it

We must break it apart and clash against it
So we can see ourselves
We must shout out loud
So it spreads wide and far
The moment soft lights spread out
And chases away the darkness
We must wake up again
To the new morning

They look at me with arrogance
Already sitting at a different start line
The distance is far, yeah
As if our shouts won’t be heard

Countless and earnest dreams
That grew as they were trampled
Blossomed over the wall, confidently
Look at that scene

We must break it apart and clash against it
So we can see ourselves
We must shout out loud
So it spreads wide and far
The moment soft lights spread out
And chases away the darkness
We must wake up again
To the new morning

Distorted truths, the lies that were taught
A voice of change, a wave is rising
The one to create an ocean that will swallow it all
It’s you

We must break it apart and clash against it
So we can see ourselves
We must shout out loud
So it spreads wide and far
The moment soft lights spread out
And chases away the darkness
We must wake up again
To the new morning

"
9,chill,"

Tonight, for no reason
I feel strange, oh no
A silhouette appears in the faint light
Then my body hardens

If not now
I can’t ever escape from you
I try running away with all my strength
But I can’t
What I do do do do do

You’re beautiful that’s why I’m afraid
A deep trap, you’re looking at me
I’m already tied up
And going to you

When I see you, when I see you
I keep getting chills

I’m feeling something way more dangerous than love
Coming right at me

Your face is something between
Expressionless and a child’s smile
That risky difference of temperature
Will I be able to handle you?

You’re beautiful that’s why I’m afraid
A deep trap, you’re looking at me
I’m already tied up
And going to you

When I see you, when I see you
I keep getting chills

Yeah I like darkness, the thicker it gets
Because it shows all, Show ya (Show ya)
Babe (Show ya)

Yeah, don’t smile like that
When I see you, feels like you’re reading my mind
I keep getting chills
I try pushing you away with cold words
But you can’t be pushed
My heart keeps wanting you
You keep digging into me as if I’m already addicted
Like a maze, there’s no exit
I try running the opposite way but in the end
I go to you

You’re hovering over my head like blanche
Your touch passes me, bewitching me
Though I know it’s a bit dangerous
I can’t escape, you’re like caffeine
Now I have to accept it
Your eyes, body, words, voice, everything
I can’t escape
When I snap out of it
I find myself calling out to you

You’re beautiful that’s why I’m afraid
A deep trap, you’re looking at me
I’m already tied up
And going to you

Hangul

Tonight 이유를 모르게
기분이 이상해 Oh no
순간 희미한 불빛에 나타난 실루엣
굳어버려 몸이

난 지금이 아니면 절대
널 벗어날 수가 없을 것만 같은 느낌 Yeah
온 힘을 다해서 달아나 봐도 안돼
What I do do do do do

아름다워 그래서 두려워
깊은 함정 나를 보는 너
나는 이미
두 발이 묶인 채로 또 너에게로

널 보면 널 보면 널 보면 널 보면 자꾸
갑자기 오싹 소름이 돋아

난 사랑보다 좀 더 훨씬 위험한 걸 느껴
Yeah 내 앞에 닥쳐올

아무 표정이 없는 얼굴과
그 아이 같은 웃음 사이
아찔한 그 온도 차
감히 내가 널 다 감당할 수 있을까

아름다워 그래서 두려워
깊은 함정 나를 보는 너
나는 이미
두 발이 묶인 채로 또 너에게로

널 보면 널 보면 널 보면 널 보면 자꾸
갑자기 오싹 소름이 돋아

Yeah 어둠이 짙을수록 좋아
다 나타나 Show ya (Show ya)
Babe (Show ya)

Yeah 그런 표정으로 웃지 마
널 보면 나의 머릿속을 읽힌 듯이
자꾸 돋아 소름이
차가운 말로 너를 밀어도 밀리지 않아
계속 널 원해 내 마음이
이미 중독된 듯이 계속해서 파고들어
마치 미로처럼 출구가 없지
억지로 반대로 달리려 해도 결국 너에게로 가

You hovering over my head like blanche
마치 홀리듯 스치는 너의 손길
조금 위험해 위험한 걸 알아도
나 빠져나올 수 없어 카페인같이
이젠 받아들여 말하는 듯한
눈빛 몸짓 말투 목소리 다
헤어 나올 수 없지
정신을 차리면 또다시 네 옆에서 너를 부르짖어

아름다워 그래서 두려워
깊은 함정 나를 보는 너
나는 이미
두 발이 묶인 채로 또 너에게로

10,going-crazy,"
It washes over me like rising fog
I’m running out of breath, it’s killing me
My scars are getting deeper, it keeps hurting
(But it was you)

I remember the nightmare of that day
But it’s not like that this time
You’re fading away
Don’t know what you want

The fog has lifted and things get clear
All the lies pass by like a reel of film
I hate you

Woo, I’m going crazy
Only a thick scar called you remains
Not even able to erase it
I’m going crazy

Your face looks like nothing’s wrong
Baby, won’t you stop?
Your excuses are useless
You drive me crazy
The moment I blink, I get cut
At the tip of your sharp tongue, just one moment
My eyes, ears, hands, feet, so much more
What have I seen and heard till now?
Is my body even my own? I can’t control it

The fog has lifted and things get clear
All the lies pass by like a reel of film
I hate you

Woo, I’m going crazy
Only a thick scar called you remains
Not even able to erase it
I’m going crazy

Going crazy

My heart is racing as if it’ll explode
I wanna know what’s next
Adrenaline rush, spreading all throughout my body
Don’t know what you do to me Oh

The decision my rationale tells me is just one
But my heart is shaking
Call me crazy but I still want you

Up and down like a rollercoaster
Have I not learned my lesson yet?
I’m falling into a tornado filled swamp
I’m flailing, three times, four times, keeps repeating

11,for-life,"
A mystery came to me
With a face of an angel
Your warmth
The only one who loves you
Staying by your side
Is that me?
In the cold winter morning
And a bit lonely in the night
We’re here together
The darkness has changed
To light with you, tonight
An unbelievable miracle

Today, hugging you tightly
Giving you my heart and soul
Because you’re my everything in life, for life
Even if I’m born again
I can’t be with anyone but you

A thousand words are not enough to express my mind, for life

When you are tired or have a hard time
I’ll be the person
You want to lean on
A person that’s like a Christmas tree
With lots of presents
Which I dreamt of when I was young

Life is a long harmony
We can be more beautiful
As we’re melted in it
Silence has changed (Silence has changed)
To a song called you, tonight (To a song, tonight)
[XM/SH] I want to listen to it forever

Today, hugging you tightly
Giving you my heart and soul
Because you’re my everything in life, for life
Oh even if I’m born again
I can’t be with anyone but you

I only want to look at you forever

Everything isn’t going to be easy
But I’ll protect you, for life
This love, this love
It will never end

Oh, never gonna let you go
Giving you my heart and soul
Because you’re my everything in life, for life
Oh even if I’m born again
I can’t be with anyone but you

I only want to look at you forever
I only want to look at you forever
For life

"
12,for-life-chinese-version,"
You’re too beautiful for me to touch
Like an angel, mesmerizing when I come closer
Body temperature drops

Please stay, don’t separate us
There’s a person still here
Loving you
Winter has cold mornings and sad evenings
But this time it all goes
From cold to beautiful
The dark night is covered
In your light tonight
This miracle will not come again

Hug me tightly today, don’t go
Giving you my heart and soul
You complete my everything, for life
Even if I am reborn
You are still my motivation to move forward

Afraid that no matter how much I
Spoil and love you, it won’t be enough, for life

When you’re tired I’ll be there
I will straighten my back
So you can lean on it
During my childhood days I wanted to be
A man as silent as a
Christmas tree, who only knows how to give

You and I, our everything
Is like beautiful gentle music
We’re different but still harmonious
Silently getting replaced (Silently getting replaced)
The song so fitting for the rhythm tonight (This song tonight)
[XM/SH] I absolutely won’t change the TV channel

Hug me tightly today, don’t go
Giving you my heart and soul
You complete my everything, for life
Oh even if I am reborn
You are still my motivation to move forward

Love for a lifetime, unwavering gazes

Hold my hand in times of difficulty
Don’t be scared, I’m here, for life
This love, this love
When life ends it still exists

Oh, never gonna let you go
Giving you my heart and soul
You complete what I’ve been waiting for
Oh even if I am reborn
You are still my motivation to move forward

Love for a lifetime, unwavering gazes
I only know that my love will never leave you
For life

你美得 触不及
像天使 挨近看似谜
体温揭底
留下吧 不分离
有一个人正在这里
爱着你

寒冷冬季的晨辉
伤感黄昏但这一回
已从落寞变优美
黑夜被你的
光芒所覆盖 Tonight
这奇迹不会重来

抱紧我今天别走
Giving you my heart and soul
你完整 我所有 For life
就算重生的路口
是你才有前往的理由

怕再多疼爱
也不够我爱 For life

你累时 有我陪
我一定挺直
背让你能依偎
童年时想成为
一个沉稳像
Christmas tree的人只懂给

你和我的这一切
像悦耳温和的和弦
音不同却很和谐
安静被取代 (安静被取代)
歌曲多合拍 Tonight (这歌曲 Tonight)
[XM/SH] 我绝不转换电台

抱紧我今天别走
Giving you my heart and soul
你完整 我所有 For life
Oh 就算重生的路口
是你才有前往的理由

一辈子的爱 目光移不开

艰难时握紧我的手
有我在别怕 For life
This love, this love
等生命结束还存在

Oh, never gonna let you go
Giving you my heart and soul
你完整我所有等待
Oh 就算重生的路口
是你才有前往的理由

一辈子的爱 目光移不开
我只懂我爱 对你离不开
For life

This street is completely crazy
Strangers in between people
Every moment that we’re together
Like boom boom boom boom boom
What up

Hey girl, that one moment felt like eternity
(the fate-like moment)
When you pierced into me in just one moment
(like lightning, in this world)
You called my name and came to me

It’s amazing, like a flash of light
You fill me up the moment I see you, oh my
Sit here comfortably and listen to my story now

Oh I don’t care
Even if I have to go far
I’ll be the one man to be by your side

You seeped into my dry lips
And woke me up

So don’t wait, don’t wait too long

There are many who shine
But look at what’s real among them
Call me baby, Call me baby

17,my-answer-chinese-version,"

I appear to have
A sunny smile on my face
But I am often all alone
I maintain my silence
Pretending I’m very free and at ease
But I have something that I want to say
The first time I saw you
I was attracted to you
I don’t have any struggling complicated thoughts
But I want to say

The answer is you
My answer is you
For a long time I’ve had my heart wide open for you
You are my everything
I am so sure

I should be more careful
And cherish myself more
So that I won’t get hurt
It seems as if I’m almost unable to breathe
This is the first time that I’ve felt this way

My mind is filled with you
I saw your facial expression
And heard your laughter

The answer is you
(That is you)
My answer is you
(Only you)
For a long time I’ve had my heart wide open for you
You are my everything
I am so sure

The simple sentence “I’m waiting for you”
But I’m unable to say what I’ve written down and erase it again
I close my eyes to try and guess what you’re doing
I repeat this all day long

I am waiting for you, you, you
Open up your heart, you, you
My out of control feelings are raging
You are my everything
Until forever, my love
(Oh I’m nothing)
Don’t leave me
Just please let me stay by your side
(Just please let me stay by your side)
Even if I think about it some more it’ll be the same
(Oh it’s you)
My answer
It’s you
It’s you

"
18,exodus-chinese-version,"

Yeah, babe. My queen You control my mind
Stand up!
Please don’t go, but your answer is still no
My heart has been shattered
Sparkling as they hang in mid-air
I’ve become entranced because of you, surrounded, there is no exit
Eventually, I come back to my original place
Trapped in love’s maze

Your beauty is so blinding
So bright that the sun nearly cannot be seen
In that moment, I closed my eyes
Even the raging fire in front of me
Is covered by your brightness
Lighting up all of my emotions

You are like a dream, the most cruel queen
Hiding your striking beauty, leaving me entranced
Dangerous Dangerous She’s so dangerous

The loneliness that flourishes, spreads in my dreamland
I forcefully tear it away, escape in another direction
Exodus Exodus It’s my Exodus

Stand back!
I shout the domino in my heart
I fall for you
Yet you don’t even blink once in my direction
There’s no turning back
There’s nothing I can do
I deeply sigh
My whole body has no more strength girl

You’re shock in my mind
Your words echo and fill my entire world
I can’t hear anything except you
They can say whatever they want
I would not even listen to it
I am solely focused on missing you

You are like a dream, the most cruel queen
Hiding your striking beauty, leaving me entranced
Dangerous Dangerous She’s so dangerous

The loneliness that flourishes, spreads in my dreamland
I forcefully tear it away, escape in another direction
Exodus Exodus It’s my Exodus

You heart is like a clear castle wall
I am the only prisoner, sacrificing freedom for love
I’ve gone crazy for you, don’t want to lie anymore
My heart is beating for you, my heart hurts for you
She’s dangerously hot

In your embrace, I’m the weak king
I abandoned everything just to have you
Dangerous Dangerous She’s so dangerous

From your embrace I am looking for a road to escape
Running towards the light at the exit, running away from your sweetness
Exodus Exodus It’s my Exodus
Yeah she’s a dangerous girl

Exodus
Exodus

19,el-dorado-chinese-version,"

I had the same dream
In an empty desert
At the far end is a dazzling city
That vanish before we get there

To get to the place I want to reach
But i’m not scared it’s far away and It’s a hard journey
Even if there’s no way to fully affirm
No way to predict the future I will still go

Find the El Dorado
Right now I’m preparing to move forward
It will be risky
Very fatal, and dangerous

Follow closely the ray of light unfolded in front of our eyes
Move towards the tomorrow that nobody knows about
After this long stel, it will turns into a legend
The El Dorado
Even though one day we will end up in the raging storm
As long as we’re together
There is no need to be afraid oh El Dorado rado

To find the paradise
Sail sail sail gotta gotta go go
Gotta find the El Drado El Dorado do
Sail sail sail gotta gotta go go
Gotta find the El Dorado El Dorado

I might hear a soundless wind blowing
Where did that blow come from? A golden melody
Close your eyes and it will be more evident
I can hear it clearly
The mysterious place in my heart

There’s no way to predict the end
There’s no way to return to the start

Find the El Dorado
This place is calling me
I will never stop at this place
And remains still

Follow closely the ray of light unfolded in front of our eyes
Move towards the tomorrow that nobody knows about
After this long step, it will turns into a legend
The El Dorado
Even though one day we will end up in the raging storm
As long as we’re together
There is no need to be afraid oh El Dorado rado

At a faraway place
Even with big sand wave rolling torrentially at me
This is my destiny, that is El Dorado

Sail sail sail gotta gotta go go
Gotta find the El Dorado El Dorado

No matter how rough the journey is, get over all the obstacles
The road in front is getting brighter
Because we faced this all together
No pain No gain This is the unknown world
Ten fingers put together
This kind of energy, we are the one

Now we’re here
Infinite time has brushed past us
We’re anticipating the start of the future miracle in front of our eyes even more
That’s right believe in me, every face says, prove yourself
That faith was never wrong

Follow closely the ray of light unfolded in front of our eyes
Move towards the tomorrow that nobody knows about
After this long step, it will turns into a legend
The El Dorado
Standing under the same sky
Under the same name we are one body
Trust in each other oh El Dorado rado

Sail sail sail gotta gotta go go
Gotta find the El Dorado El Dorado do
Sail sail sail gotta gotta go go
Gotta find the El Dorado El Dorado

At a faraway place
Even with big sand wave rolling torrentially at me
We fight together, to reach El Dorado

Sail sail sail gotta gotta go go
Gotta find the El Dorado El Dorado

20,playboy-chinese-version,"

Hey Playboy haha boy Let’s play

Don’t answer the phone, quietly let it ring
We need to save some time
It’s nothing important that you need to answer
Making you worry
Don’t worry, don’t worry
I can see how you’re feeling
Don’t worry, don’t worry, don’t worry
Let me unlock the key to you

The dark night, my dark heart stays in your place
Lighting up, your heart has always been in my place
Two hearts that are separated can’t play together

Please forget the words that froze at my base
Your words disappear but they leave your trace
Two hearts too crowded can’t let you play (boy)

Play play boy
Play play boy
Play boy Play boy Play

Your eyes say that
You’ve seen the real reason too late
You’ve already secretly fallen in love with me (Isn’t it?)
You already knew from the beginning
But now you’re blaming me with your reasons
I’m bad, worse than you can imagine
What you found isn’t what you have thought of
You thought wrong; following me won’t bring happiness closer to you
Please don’t try to leave again

Don’t worry, don’t worry
I can see how you’re feeling
Don’t worry, don’t worry, don’t worry
Let me unlock the key to you

The dark night, my dark heart stays in your place
Lighting up, your heart has always been in my place
Two hearts that are separated can’t play together

Please forget the words that froze at my base
Your words disappear but they leave your trace
Two hearts too crowded can’t let you Play Play Play

Uh, playboy!

I already know what to call each other and
Now it left just one kiss, that’s all
Meeting someone like me is fortune or ill-fate
You know the answer?
It’s both yes! It’s like you’ve drank Whisky

Letting you to feel a dizzy mind, your face turning red
(leggo)
The more you resist to it, the more it excited me
I said there are still games to play, the main game hasn’t started yet
Try to fight, try it again
Winning means nothing to me

I’ll soothe away my loneliness with this fresh feeling everyday

Oh! I really don’t want to stop
We actually have the same feelings
You don’t really want to see me leave (Right?)
My babe

The dark night, my dark heart stays in your place
Lighting up, your heart has always been in my place
Two hearts that are separated can’t play together

Please forget the words that froze at my base
Your words disappear but they leave your trace
Two hearts too crowded can’t let you play (boy)

Play play boy
Play play boy
Play boy Play boy Play

21,growl,"
Yo, okay

I’m warning you just in case (listen carefully)
It’s dangerous now (so dangerous)
Stop provoking me (there’s going to be trouble)
I don’t even know myself

My breath keeps on stopping
You walk towards me
You smile at me
Maybe you’re attracted to me too

My sights become dark
When you stare at me
The sound of your breathing
You’re the one that makes me crazy

So nobody can look at you (when you smile)
I want to hide you inside my embrace (I’m so serious)
The stares that are after you
Wakes up inside me
There’s a harsh/fierce swirl/storm

A dark shadow has woken up inside of me
Sparks fly in my eyes as I look at you
Everyone step away from her (step away)
It’s going to get fierce from now on
I’m growling, growling, growling
I’m growling, growling, growling
I’m growling, growling, growling
If you don’t back away then I don’t care if you get hurt

With agitated stare and cutting tension
I’m searching your surroundings
You just stay still and look at me
I’ll never let you go you’ll see

The stares that are seeking you who’s vividly shining in the blurry space
The sound of the alarm is ringing in me

A dark shadow has woken up inside of me
Sparks fly in my eyes as I look at you
Everyone step away from her (step away)
It’s going to get fierce from now on
I’m growling, growling, growling
I’m growling, growling, growling
I’m growling, growling, growling
If you don’t back away then I don’t care if you get hurt

E X O

Just in case another wolf looks at you
Because my girl is too perfect
I hold you softly within me [OR] I embrace you softly
I become violent just for you

Only the strong one gets the beautiful woman
Just go back because there’s no place
You have zero chance
Stop looking you’re going to wear her out
If you desire her you have to win against me first

Let’s erase everyone one by one except us
Paused as if only you and I exist here

A dark shadow has woken up inside of me
Sparks fly in my eyes as I look at you
Everyone step away from her (step away)
It’s going to get fierce from now on
I’m growling, growling, growling
I’m growling, growling, growling
I’m growling, growling, growling
If you don’t back away then I don’t care if you get hurt

I’m growling, growling, growling
I’m growling, growling, growling
I’m growling, growling, growling
If you don’t back away then I don’t care if you get hurt

Korean Original

[Intro]
Yo, okay (sexy) 나 혹시 몰라 경고하는데 (잘들어)
지금 위험해 (So dangerous)
자꾸 나를 자극하지마 (큰일나) 나도 날 몰라

[Verse 1]
숨이 자꾸 멎는다 네가 날 향해 걸어온다
나를 보며 웃는다 너도 내게 끌리는지
눈앞이 다 캄캄해 네가 뚫어져라 쳐다볼 땐
귓가에 가까워진 숨소리 날 미치게 만드는 너인걸

[Verse 2]
아무도 널 못 보게 품에 감추고 싶어
널 노리는 시선들 내 안에 일어난 거센 소용돌이

[Hook]
검은 그림자 내 안에 깨어나 널 보는 두 눈에 불꽃이 튄다
그녀 곁에서 모두 다 물러나 이젠 조금씩 사나워진다
나 으르렁 으르렁 으르렁 대 나 으르렁 으르렁 으르렁 대
나 으르렁 으르렁 으르렁 대 너 물러서지 않으면 다쳐도 몰라

[Verse 3]
날이 선 눈빛과 베일듯한 긴장감
지금 탐색 중이야 너의 주위를 babe, oh
넌 그냥 그대로 있어 나만을 바라보면서
절대 널 보내지 않아 두고 봐 babe

[Verse 4]
흐린 공간속에서 선명하게 빛나는
널 노리는 시선들 내 안에 울리는 경보 울림소리

[Hook]
검은 그림자 내 안에 깨어나 널 보는 두 눈에 불꽃이 튄다
그녀 곁에서 모두 다 물러나 이젠 조금씩 사나워진다
나 으르렁 으르렁 으르렁 대 나 으르렁 으르렁 으르렁 대
나 으르렁 으르렁 으르렁 대 너 물러서지 않으면 다쳐도 몰라

[Verse 5]
E-X-O 또 다른 늑대들이 볼세라 너무나 완벽한 내 여자라
품속엔 부드럽게 너를 안고 너만을 위해서 나는 난폭해지고
결국엔 강한 자가 얻게 되는 미인 자리가 없으니까 그냥 돌아가 I win
가능성 제로야 닳으니까 그만 봐 그녀를 넘본다면 나를 먼저 넘어봐

[Verse 6]
우리 말곤 하나둘씩 지워버리자
너하고 나만 여기 남아 멈춰진 듯이

[Outro]
검은 그림자 내 안에 깨어나 널 보는 두 눈에 불꽃이 튄다
그녀 곁에서 모두 다 물러나 이젠 조금씩 사나워진다
나 으르렁 으르렁 으르렁 대 나 으르렁 으르렁 으르렁 대
나 으르렁 으르렁 으르렁 대 너 물러서지 않으면 다쳐도 몰라
나 으르렁 으르렁 으르렁 대 나 으르렁 으르렁 으르렁 대
나 으르렁 으르렁 으르렁 대 (너 물러서지 않으면 다쳐도 몰라)

Don’t hesitate, move on
There’s no time
Your future depends on your imagination
Throw away your fear, we can do it, it’s okay
All the keys are in your possession

[Verse 2]
You used to dream even when you weren’t asleep
I hope you never forget
Today, let’s burn it up with fun together
Like we’ve become one, feeling feeling
So turn me up

[Pre-Chorus]
We got that power power
Whenever you see me
Whenever we feel each other’s hearts
Power power
We become stronger
Turn the music up now

[Chorus]
We got that power power
Through this music
When we sing with one voice
Power power
We become stronger
Turn the music up now

[Post-Chorus]
Power power
Turn the music up now

[Verse 3]
Don’t worry anymore, stop
Time is ticking, even now, tik tok
We take a shot
Let’s go, we got bang bang pow wow
With the melody that comes out of your earphones
Shut out all the noise and turn the volume up high
We got that power everytime

[Verse 4]
You used to dream even when you weren’t asleep
I hope you never forget
Today, let’s burn it up with fun together
Like we’ve become one, feeling feeling
So turn me up

[Pre-Chorus]
We got that power power
Whenever you see me
Whenever we feel each other’s hearts
Power power
We become stronger
Turn the music up now

[Chorus]
We got that power power
Through this music
When we sing with one voice
Power power
We become stronger
Turn the music up now

[Bridge]
When tiring days come, remember babe
The beautiful us
The power to get up again
It’s in you
We got that

[Chorus]
We got that power power
Through this music
When we sing with one voice
Power power
We become stronger
Turn the music up now

[Outro]
Power power
Turn the music up now
We got that
We got that
