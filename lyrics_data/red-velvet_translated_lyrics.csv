It’s getting higher, these endless stairs
After I climb to the sky, I’ll keep following this feeling

When I look into my heart
There’s a world I’ve never seen before
Like a light bulb turning on
Shine the light that resembles your charms

This light has a warm taste
So bright
Such a pretty color
I can’t stop expressing my awe

Right now, right now, right now
Right in this moment
Here, here, there, there
Shine a light on me
Look look look look

It’s not dangerous, trust your eyes
You don’t need to worry
You don’t need it

Do you want to walk across the big sky?
Tell me your true story
Like a light bulb turning on
Shine on me brightly from high above

This light has a warm taste
So bright
Such a pretty color
I can’t stop expressing my awe

Right now, right now, right now
Right in this moment
Here, here, there, there
Shine a light on me
Look look look look

You wrap around me like the sun rising
Hug me while it’s the day time
Even when the clouds cover me
Pierce through and find me

Right now, right now, right now
Right in this moment
Here, here, there, there
Shine a light on me
Look look look look

"
3,i-just,"

It’s time to stop crying

I hear the sun rising after the darkness
It’s still nighttime in a corner of my room
Piece by piece, it’s breaking down
My old and dusty, small bag

I blowed on it, touching the old scars
I found the key, finally I’m opening the heart

I wanna leave

What I need more right now
Is a pair of shoes to take me away somewhere
So I won’t heart, so I won’t stop
So I won’t get more tired
So long so long

Will we meet at the end of this road?
Did we miss each other in this maze?

This story isn’t over yet
It remains here, empty like this

Ah-y-ah Y-ah Y-ah Y-ah-y
I just leave I I just leave I
Ah-y-ah Y-ah Y-ah Y-ah-y
I just leave I I just

When I close my eyes, it gets slow
Your voice, your breath, your smile comes to me again
On my lips, the flow, your name
I’m swallowing it up, feels like I could burst, I’m running again

Ah-y-ah Y-ah Y-ah Y-ah-y
I just leave I I just leave I
Ah-y-ah Y-ah Y-ah Y-ah-y

4,kingdom-come,"

Tag it uh yeah

In just one moment, your eyes dig into me
Without anyone knowing, my hidden heart was stolen
Feels like I’m walking on a path in a faraway dream
It’s an emotion that has never touched me before

With wet words (secretly)
You drench my heart again (softly)
Then you disappear with a smile
A light that has blinded me
Feels like I’ve seen a new world
I took courage and approached you

You only spread before me
I’m colored with you
You fill my heart
Baby I will love you till kingdom come
I won’t wake from this dream baby
Forever, I got you, you got me
Love you till kingdom come

The scent of your gestures made me look back at you
Ecstatic over the white flowers under my feet
Shining but still thorny
But I’ll still hold out my hand
As if I’m bewitched, approaching you

You only spread before me
I’m colored with you
You fill my heart
Baby I will love you till kingdom come
I won’t wake from this dream baby
Forever, I got you, you got me
Love you till kingdom come

Even if you’re a fantasy that’ll disappear once I open my eyes
I won’t let you go
Never ever never ever, forever
Like my heart stopped
(I got you, you got me)
I wanna fall asleep like this
(I got you, you got me)

The more steps I take, the deeper it gets
I lost myself but I keep getting pulled
Endlessly falling into you
Baby I will love you till kingdom come
I won’t wake from this dream baby
Forever, I got you, you got me
Love you till kingdom come

I got you, you got me
I got you, you got me
I love you till kingdom come

"
5,time-to-love,"

I desperately dream to walk in the comfy snow together every day
You seemed so far away, and now you’re standing by my side

A cold wind blows and with your hand, you brush my unruly hair back
Am I seeing this? It’s weird, I think you’re nervous today

I think I know that two people have fallen in love
Ah shall we begin, how I’ve waited this Time to love

I’m embarassed to be face to face (I wanna see) but I can’t muster up the courage
We keep walking for a while and then our hands brush past each other (along with my heart) I’m surprised

Like sparkling lights, I’m sparkling in your eyes

I think I know that two people have fallen in love
Ah shall we begin, how I’ve waited this Time to love

This doesn’t make sense (you make my heart flutter every time)
You’re holding my hand (why does my face flush)
Now my wish is (the streets look like it’s painted)
About to come true (with us)

Will you disappear if I close my eyes
I don’t wanna waste even a second, please stay like this

White snow is falling (like it’s been promised)
You’re falling in my heart (You’re piling so much)
Ah I’m in your arms and this winter night is warmer than anything

Oh baby I think I know (Now I think I know how you feel)
That two people have fallen in love (I think we’re dreaming the same dream Baby)
Ah it all feels like a dream, like the first snow we’ve been waiting for (like a gift)
Now it’s our Time to love

"
6,my-second-date,"

Today is my second date uh

Should I start speaking informally?
Should I softly grab your arm?
Should I close my eyes for a moment?
Today is my second date

I already showed you my best outfit
I keep getting more and more worried
You still haven’t told me your favorite movie
I still have so much to ask
Should I be more aggressive?
What if you get scared and run away?
From A to Z, it’s all so awkward
Dumb Dumb

Tick tock, stop Time time
My heart keeps pounding
I can’t lose the third date
What do I do?
My second date

Should I start speaking informally?
Should I softly grab your arm?
Should I close my eyes for a moment?
Today is my second date
My second date
My second date

Heart is pounding, I rehearsed all last night
Just like I practiced, slowly, 1, 2, 3
I have so many things on my wish list
I’m sure a kiss is still a dream
Heart is pounding, slowly, 1, 2, 3

Tick tock, stop Time time
My heart keeps pounding
I can’t lose the third date
What do I do?
My second date

Should I start speaking informally?
Should I softly grab your arm?
Should I close my eyes for a moment?
Today is my second date
My second date
My second date

As if I didn’t know, as if it was a mistake
Should I trip and fall, grab your arm?
Should I wait a little more?
Nothing changed from the first date
Locking lips, too early?
Right? No, you never know
At first, I closed one eye
I wanna close both eyes today

I couldn’t do anything and only time passes
I couldn’t do anything and only time passes Baby
I couldn’t do anything and only time passes
Tick tock tick tock
I couldn’t do anything and only time passes Baby

Should I start speaking informally?
Should I softly grab your arm?
Should I close my eyes for a moment?
Today is my second date
My second date
My second date
My second date
My second date

7,perfect-10,"

Light Camera Action Uh
Everything is perfect
Hit the button and push record

Day night, I don’t care
I’ll follow my five senses
Feels real, following how I feel
A scent that resembles you overflows

Your heart is a clear, square frame
I’m the subject that wants to live inside
With the sweet light
I’m waiting for you

My black eyes, close up
All of me, close up
So my honest heart can get closer
As if we can touch, closer

I’ll be your perfect 10, 10, 10
Be your perfect 10, 10, 10
Each cut is 10, 10, 10
When you place me in your arms
No more, no less, perfect

Rewinding the film of my memories
I’m looking at myself from when we were together
So unreal, how could I spend
Each minute and each second, looking at you?

Your soft smile is a flash to me
With that light, I get brighter
A subject that only follows you
Walking together in the rain that night
We were so picturesque, yeah

My black eyes, close up
All of me, close up
So my honest heart can get closer
I wanna show you

I’ll be your perfect 10, 10, 10
Be your perfect 10, 10, 10
Each cut is 10, 10, 10
When you place me in your arms
No more, no less, perfect

Don’t lose a single moment right now
Feels like I can melt
A different kiss, a different trembling, feel brand new
I’ll leave all of my moments only with you

My smooth hair, close up
Everything you want, close up
Even my trembling breath
It’s all for you

I’ll be your perfect 10, 10, 10
Be your perfect 10, 10, 10
Each cut is 10, 10, 10
When you place me in your arms
No more, no less, perfect

8,about-love,"

Sometimes, I tell you that love is still hard for me
Then you just (slightly) look at me and (smile)
Without a word, you warmly hold my hands

It’s strange, when I’m with you, when it’s just us two
Things that aren’t a big deal, things you didn’t even ask about, I say it all
Just by listening to my stories
Makes me feel like you’re forever on my side

If I say your name
It feels like I’m saying I love you
I can’t hide it, my heart pounds
I call and call out to you but it’s like that every day
Looking at each other right now
Feels like love
I wish time would stop for just us two

Sometimes, I meet my friends and go places
I eat good food and it makes me happy
But I keep thinking about you, right, so I take pictures, take
Swearing that I’ll come here with you next time (that’s right)

Whatever we talk about
I keep showing off about you
Even when we are apart
Two of us, always, two of us
Feels like you’re next to me even now

When tears fall at the end of a tiring day
Without a word, you lend me your shoulders
When you hug me like my dad
It makes me feel like you’re forever on my side

If I say your name
It feels like I’m saying I love you
I can’t hide it, my heart pounds
I call and call out to you but it’s like that every day
Looking at each other right now
Feels like love
I wish time would stop for just us two

Sometimes, I’m surprised
How can we be thinking the same thoughts
All the time?

Honestly, I thought about this sometimes
Maybe we’re the same person
Or else how can you explain all of this?

I keep smiling when I see you, I know this is love
Our hands are on top of each other
I feel your heart without missing anything
Now I’ll show you how much my love has grown
It’s nothing special but
I wanna fill myself with you alone

If I say your name
It feels like I’m saying I love you
I can’t hide it, my heart pounds
I call and call out to you but it’s like that every day
Looking at each other right now
Feels like love
I wish time would stop for just us two

"
9,moonlight-melody,"

It was especially bright
On that night, when my heart fluttered so much
Felt like you’ll notice
So I kept stepping backwards

Suddenly, I heard the sound of bells
Coming from somewhere

Is it the moon?
Was it shining on us and did it want to say something?
I’ve never heard it before
That unforgettable sound of the moonlight

Sometimes, no many times, I think of that night
Feels like you can hear my heart
So I’m closing the windows

I suddenly remembered so I smiled
The sound of the bells in my ears

Is it the moon?
Was it shining on us and did it want to say something?
I’ve never heard it before
That unforgettable sound of the moonlight

Do you remember?
It sang for us, it blessed us
Out of the many stars
It was the biggest and brightest

Every day, I’m at that place
I tune my ears but I can’t hear it anymore
The precious and unforgettable sound of the moonlight

You need to “Beat It”
That boy Michael Jackson ”Bad”
I’m not your “Billie Jean”
Don’t you “Leave Me Alone”
But you’re so ambiguous, I want “Black Or White”
I can’t give up on you, my “Man In The Mirror”
“Why You Wanna Trip On Me”
You’re too harsh
Boy, you make me “Scream”
Why am I like this?
Well, your “Love really Never Felt So Good”
It’s so electrifying that it’s like watching the “Thriller”

[Verse 4]
I can’t escape from you
I hate you but I don’t
I wanna be like that unni
But you keep calling me cute

Like my little brother’s robot, everything is so awkward
What do I do? I think I’m broken, I forgot even how to breathe

“Why You Wanna Trip On Me”
넌 너무 짓궂지
Boy, you make me “Scream”
너에게 왜 이러지
하긴 너의 “Love"" 정말 ""Never Felt So Good”
그건 아마 짜릿하다 못해 Watching the “Thriller”

[Verse 6]
난 너에게서 헤어날 수 없나 봐
미워도 싫지가 않잖아
저 언니처럼 되고 싶은데
넌 자꾸 나를 귀엽다고 하는 걸까 왜

11,red-dress,"

Yeah you know how we do
Our tune is so high

You look at me as if I’m a child
You smile as you look down at me, patting my head
Why do you keep pretending not to know?
Why do you think I called you on this nice, sunny day?

Tell me what you want what you want it
Tell me your honest ideal type
Show me what you want what you want it
From her head, shoulders knees and toes
If I wanna know, if I wanna be her, I wonder what you’ll say

Get up get up get up get up
Get up get up get up get up
Get up get up get up get up
You can be excited for me

I’ll be confident like a red ruby
I’ll be somewhat cunning like a red apple
A feel good red dress, red dress, red dress
To captivate you, red dress, red dress, red dress

My sweet love, when I call out to you
I don’t want to hesitate anymore
What do you think about me, haven’t I changed a little?
Up and down, look at my thin waist, red dresses on

Get up get up get up get up
Get up get up get up get up
Get up get up get up get up
You can come closer

I won’t ever stop like red slippers
My thorns will be sharp like a red rose
A feel good red dress, red dress, red dress
To captivate you, red dress, red dress, red dress

This isn’t easy for me to say
I’m not just a young child

I got a clear feeling
My pounding heart, my loving smile
It’s shouting out that it’s you

"
12,day-1,"

Like the day I first wore my school uniform
I feel awkward and excited
I couldn’t sleep at all because of
Your sudden confession last night
We’re different from yesterday, we’re not friends
But I have a request, promise me

Kiss kiss kiss, don’t leave a day out
Love love love, whisper to me before I sleep
As much as you want it, as much as I waited
Hug me, love me with all your heart

You were so obvious for all this time
But that made my heart flutter even more

I’m holding your hand for the first time
Without knowing, my heart is pounding

Kiss kiss kiss, don’t leave a day out
Love love love, whisper to me before I sleep
As much as you want it, as much as I waited
Hug me with all your heart

More than yesterday, more than today
I hope my heart grows bigger
So I won’t be lonely, so we won’t be sad
I’ll stick by your side

Step by step, I like walking with you
I like this song that only we know
Even if a long time passes
Not as a habit but hug me with all your heart

Time is too precious, I wanna see you again tomorrow
As much as you want it, as much as I waited
Hug me with all your heart, I love you

14,with-you,"

It’s just the two of us and the white sands
It almost feels like we’re in a snowy scenery
Under the red sun, your sun burnt nose looks just like Rudolf’s

When I’m with you, when I’m with you
It feels like Christmas in the middle of summer
When I’m with you, when I’m with you
Every moment feels like a gift I’ve been waiting for

Yeah you’re fluttering, fluttering
Filling up my heart to the brim
I’m like a yacht riding the waves of you
It’s a racing, refreshing feeling
And between this tender moment
I hear a bell, I hear a bell in my head
It must be your voice
Even that red lighthouse afar looks like a Christmas tree
And I want to make a wish

When I’m with you, when I’m with you
It feels like Christmas in the middle of summer
When I’m with you, when I’m with you
Every moment feels like a gift I’ve been waiting for

When I’m with you, when I’m with you
Even when summer is over
When I’m with you, when I’m with you
I hope we’ll stay the same together

The shining stars above are like the first snow fall
As the two of us kiss, it’s like a dream

When I’m with you, when I’m with you
It feels like Christmas in the middle of summer
When I’m with you, when I’m with you
Every moment feels like a gift I’ve been waiting for

When I’m with you, when I’m with you
It feels like Christmas in the middle of summer
When I’m with you, when I’m with you
Every moment feels like a heartfelt gift

Are you there, Santa Claus? My wish is…
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
For us to be together for every summer that’s to come
Oh oh oh oh oh
No I won’t cry

With you, with you
With you, with you
With you, with you
With you, with you

A Christmas in the middle of summer
When I’m with you

15,red-flavor,"

[Chorus: All]
Red flavor, I’m curious honey
It tastes like slowly melting strawberry when I bite into it
Look for the corner candy shop baby
What I like the most is the taste of summer

[Verse 1: Joy, Wendy, Yeri]
I wanna fall asleep underneath a palm tree
While the hot summer night breeze blows
We’re nineteen, easily falling in love
We’re cute together and cool too

[Pre-Chorus: Wendy, Seulgi]
I like you, it was love at first sight
I keep thinking of you
I wanna go my own way

[Chorus: All]
Red flavor, I’m curious honey
It tastes like slowly melting strawberry when I bite into it
Look for the corner candy shop baby
What I like the most is the taste of summer, yeah

[Verse 2: Wendy, Joy, Irene, Yeri]
I open the door with seven rainbow colors
Your world is thrilling, it’s cool, mmh...
The color of your love is redder than the sun
I’ll take it, I want to do what I want

[Pre-Chorus: Seulgi, Wendy]
Look at me, what are you thinking about?
What can we do today?
I imagine however I want

[Chorus:All]
Red flavor, I’m curious honey (yeah)
It tastes like slowly melting strawberry when I bite into it
Look for the corner candy shop baby (yeah, hey, hey)
What I like the most is the taste of summer, yeah

[Bridge 1: Irene]
Peach juice, sweet and sour mix mood
The cocktail I wanna give you, I brew (red)
My ears are ringing and my nose is numb
This feeling is more than what I imagined up and bang (red)

[Bridge 2: Yeri]
Bet you wanna, bet you wanna dance like this
Shout it out, I like you honestly
You’re nervous and you’re dripping with sweat, you’re cute
We’re sun burnt from falling in love, we are red red uh

[Post-Chorus 1: Seulgi, Joy]
Can’t you know how I feel even when I don’t say it
My heart keeps growing
Like spilled ice cream
I might melt away

[Post-Chorus 2: Wendy, Irene, Yeri, All]
So tell me (yeah yeah tell me)
So tell me (yeah yeah tell me)
With your colors
Dye me, darker and more strikingly (baby)

[Chorus: All, Wendy]
Red flavor, I’m curious honey (honey
It) tastes like slowly melting strawberry when I bite into it (like strawberry)
Look for the corner candy shop baby
What I like the most is the taste of summer

[Outro: Wendy]
What I like the most is you in the summer

16,rebirth,"

It feels like I’m born again
Everything about me has changed
After I met you, I became a new person
My mom is the most surprised

First, I wake up early in the morning
And I turn on the music that you suggested
I don’t know why but I like that music
That song with the hard-to-memorize title

I take a shower even though I don’t have to
As I follow along with that melody
My mornings that were always so hard
How could it be so enjoyable now?

Oh, it’s so amazing, my heart for you
Oh, it’s so new, I’ve never seen myself like this before
If it’s like this every day
The world will be such a good place to live

All the handsome oppas on the subway
I don’t look at them anymore
After a few stops, I’m gonna see you
My face in the train window reflection is smiling

I was never interested in flower shops
But my feet stopped at one
I dug into my pockets and bought a bouquet
Even though it’s not a special day

The same time, the same place
Has a new meaning because of you alone
It’s so amazing, each day is so beautiful
Each minute, each second is too precious
My days are so different that it’s hard to believe
My face, the way I talk, my eyes, they’re all different
I’ve never been like this before, it’s strange baby
I think I have finally fallen in love, maybe

Oh, it’s so amazing, my heart for you
Oh, it’s so new, I’ve never seen myself like this before
If it’s like this every day
The world will be such a good place to live

"
17,you-better-know,"

After the dark night, the light filled dawn
Wakes you up
The world busily prepares to face you
As it dazzles

Stopped alone in front of a big wall
Your eyes have closed in scars
The heart fluttering of the first time, the shining attraction
Where have they gone?

When the precious dreams that made your heart beat
Calls out to you
Will you listen to this song
That will cozily embrace you?

You better know
Follow the dazzling light and draw out your day
You better know
There is a world that is waiting for you

So are you ready or not?
Don’t miss this moment
Time is ticking
Tick tock, tick tock
You better know
Some day, I’ll be by your side

It’s natural to get lost like a child
On unfamiliar paths (unfamiliar paths)
Like the slowly blossoming wildflowers
You can slowly take a break (ah...)

When you need a breeze
To comfort your tired heart
Will you listen to this song
That aromatically blows over?

You better know
Follow the dazzling light and draw out your day
You better know
There is a world that is waiting for you

So are you ready or not?
Don’t miss this moment
Time is ticking
Tick tock, tick tock

You better know
You better know

So are you ready or not?
The times you’ve been waiting for
Are getting closer to you
Tick tock, tick tock

So are you ready or not
Don’t just stay in place
Draw out a bigger dream
Tick tock, tick tock

You better know
Follow the dazzling light and draw out your day
You better know
There is a world that is waiting for you (you better know)

So are you ready or not?
Don’t miss this moment
Time is ticking
Tick tock, tick tock
You better know
Some day, I’ll be by your side

You better know
You better know
You better know
You better

18,zoo,"

Ooh Ho
Ooh Ho

I opened my eyes and everything is so weird
What is going on
Did I fall from flying in the sky

Strange sounds and green forest
What is this place
I’m standing
In a dream-like jungle

The moment I fell into a love that I imagined
It brings me to another world like a miracle
It’s mysterious and beautiful, I can’t take my eyes off
All of this, all of this
Love is lookin’ like a zoo
Yeah It’s lookin’ like a zoo
Like a fantastical zoo
Yeah It’s lookin’ like a zoo zoo zoo zoo

Ah
Uh come on uh come on let’s do it
It’s amazing Uh everything is Oh
When it’s unfolding before my eyes
I get excited from curiosity
That I dance cutely

I get startled and climb a tree
And I’d hide, secretly secretly
Before I know it, I’ve completely fallen for this place
My heart is going Bum bum bitty bum bum

When I reach out, I think the whole world is going to be mine
When I dip my feet, the water rises and my heart rises too
When I breathe out, the smell of the grass permeates
I’m happy like a child in the picturesque jungle

The moment I fell into a love that I imagined
It brings me to another world like a miracle
It’s mysterious and beautiful, I can’t take my eyes off
All of this, all of this
Love is lookin’ like a zoo
Yeah It’s lookin’ like a zoo
Like a fantastical zoo
Yeah It’s lookin’ like a zoo zoo zoo zoo

In an unfamiliar world that I’ve met for the first time
Without realizing the time is passing by
I’m falling deeper and deeper into it
Baby baby baby, I get more curious
I want it you know it, what is all of this
I feel it you got it, a secret that makes your heart beat
A bam bada boom bam bada boom hey
If this is a dream, I hope we don’t wake up

I want you baby baby
Ooh-la-la Ooh-la-la-la-la-la
Hurry Baby baby
Ooh-la-la Ooh-la-la-la-la-la
All of you

The moment I held your hand, which is like Tarzan
You fly through the woods holding me, just like a movie
It’s mysterious and beautiful, I can’t take my eyes off
All of this, all of this
Love is lookin’ like a zoo
Yeah It’s lookin’ like a zoo
Like a fantastical zoo
Yeah It’s lookin’ like a zoo zoo zoo zoo

19,hear-the-sea,"

I hear the sea, closer to my ears today for some reason
The light that was hot all day has dyed red now
The clouds have risen and the air is just humid enough
A memory like a growing shadow, I hear the sea

The sound of the waves and your voice
Twinkling brighter than the stars
Your eyes were deep and black
Your heart resembles a day sun
All of it is a story that this season holds

Somewhere, now
Are you feeling it like I am
You and I used to share stories
Until the early mornings
When one corner of the sky would change its color back again
I hear the summer

The sound of the waves and your voice
Twinkling brighter than the stars
Your eyes were deep and black
Your heart resembles a day sun
All of it is a story that this season holds

I didn’t know the summer night dream
Would be this long and deep
Today’s weather keeps
Calling for you
It makes me miss you

I hear the sea, I feel you
The scent and the touch of that day
And my feelings too, all of it
Your heart resembles a day sun
All of it is a story that this season holds

"
20,little-little,"

All the feelings that made my heart beat
I avoided you because I thought you might hear them
But I can’t hide that I want to see you
Diary in my head
Whichever page I open
That you’re the only one for me, it’s a Secret that only I know

One by one, as your everything
Pile within me
For some reason, my heart is busier Oh
Without knowing that it’s a dark night
You shine in the sky
I can’t sleep because I think about you Oh

Give a little little
More love
Give a little little
More time
Even the smallest of the small things abot you
Are huge to me
There’s softly blowing breeze in my cheeks
My heart is waving because of you
It keeps blowing gently
You shake up my world

This feeling is probably Love love love

The feeling that my eyes brushed past
Makes my heart pink
It dyes and wets my entire body Yeah
My heart fills up almost that it overflows
Whenever I see you
Even the tips of my fingers emit a lovely light

Your kind habits and
The way you talk when you’re flustered
They keep spinning in my head as if I memorized them Oh
Sometimes when you tease me
When you come closer to me
I can’t even breathe Oh

Give a little little
More love
Give a little little
More time
Even the smallest of the small things about you
Are huge to me
There’s softly blowing breeze in my cheeks
My heart is waving because of you
It keeps blowing gently
You shake up my world

This feeling is probably Love love

Our softly locked eyes grow deeper
When you stay, stay as we are By my side
The piece that is you comes to me
It becomes my everything Oh

Need a little little
Give a little little
Make a little little
Make a little by little

Give a little little
More love
Give a little little
More time
Even the smallest of the small things about you
Are huge to me
There’s softly blowing breeze in my cheeks
My heart is waving because of you
It keeps blowing gently
You shake up my world

Give a little little
More love
Give a little little
More time
Whisper very quietly
So that only you can hear me
Our distance has grown closer
I wanna keep being with you
Every minute and every second, however short they may be
I only want to fill them with you

This feeling is probably Love
