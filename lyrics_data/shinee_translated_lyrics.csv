,0,1
0,all-day-all-night,"

Who can tell me whether this decision is right or wrong?
Each moment I see you is a highlight, I don’t regret it, it’s only beautiful

Let’s start running in this world, yeah it’s all for you
Time is starting to shine, yeah it’s all for you
Our tears that hurt so much, our joy that overwhelmed our hearts, all for you (x5)

It’s growing hotter, as if it’ll explode
Giving me no choice but to love you more
(Baby you’re my type of world)
Shout out loud, baby you’re my world
You’ll start to believe in this new world that is blooming even more

All day all day all night, what I wanted and hoped for
All day all day all night baby, is only you
Oh my god, the melodies ring out
All day all day all night, we’re melting into each other

Like a long preview, we’re looking at each other inside this deep connection
The scene is showing your face again, I have no choice but to look at it
The stars are clashing, let’s spark it, no need to make it hard
Feel the vibe, I’ll throw over even hotter fireworks, Baby it’s all for you

Tell me more about what you want, there’s nothing that’s prohibited
It’s ok to go crazy since you chose me
The deep and blue silence of the night, the dazzling sun of the afternoon, it’s all for you (x5)

It’s growing hotter, as if it’ll explode
Giving me no choice but to love you more
(Baby you’re my type of world)
Shout out loud, baby you’re my world
You’ll start to believe in this new world that is blooming even more

All day all day all night, what I wanted and hoped for
All day all day all night baby, is only you
Oh my god, the melodies ring out
All day all day all night, we’re melting into each other

Leave it alone, I’ll hold all of your painful scars
All of that is the control of our small wings flapping
You changed my world

It’s growing hotter, as if it’ll explode
Giving me no choice but to love you more
(Baby you’re my type of world)
Shout out loud, baby you’re my world
You’ll start to believe in this new world that is blooming even more

All day all day all night, what I wanted and hoped for
All day all day all night baby, is only you
Oh my god, the melodies ring out
All day all day all night, we’re melting into each other

Yeah I like that
All night girl, my girl, your world

"
1,good-evening,"

The cozy darkness is lingering far away, slowly coming
At the tip of the sunset that hangs on the buildings, I think of you

Spill out the darkness, open the night
I wanna see you more, right now, oh

The moonlight is rising, I’m going to you before it’s too late
I’m going to get you, imagining how surprised you’ll be
I’ll going to you, going to you, without a reason, going to you

Spilling out the night, I’m going to get you
If you happen to think of me
I’ll go to you right now
It’s too lonely at night
Don’t wanna press it down so I’m going to you right now

My breathing is getting rougher, we’re getting closer
When you said you missed me
My heart got impatient so I increased my speed

Like the rain on the window, you’re sparkling clearly
All of our stories make us run out of breath

The closer I step to you
My whole world changes through you
I want to know all of your moments
Before that moonlight

I can feel we’re looking at each other through this door
Let’s see… You’re eyes nose lips cheek
Even if you’re farther away than the sky
I’ll send my heart to the clouds, on this night with the bright moonlight

The moonlight is rising, I’m going to you before it’s too late
I’m going to get you, imagining how surprised you’ll be
I’ll going to you, going to you, without a reason, going to you

Spilling out the night, I’m going to get you
If you happen to think of me
I’ll go to you right now
It’s too lonely at night
Don’t wanna press it down so I’m going to you right now

I see you far way, you, you, you, you
Spilling out the night, I’m going to get you

"
2,chemistry,"

I don’t have any thoughts to leave you alone
Don’t you think about just sitting there like a frozen picture

When we look at each other, we’re more perfect than ever
I’ll run to you to shake things up a bit more frequently

So it touches your skin, so it seems real, feel it more
Catch me, I have my arms open wide

The deeper I fall, the more I’m provoked without rest
I want to show you everything and give all the impact
Has it hit you yet? The more I get into your emotion
I can’t stop so I’m trusting the love that’ll hold and shake us

Alright, alright, let’s be more honest with these following emotions
Alright, alright, yeah, the chemistry is getting thicker

If you keep your distance like this is someone else’s story
There’s nothing more to earn, with that defensive attitude

With my whole body baby, I’ll throw myself to you, clash against you
So I can feel every little part of you together

The dazzling light grows stronger, as well as the scent and touch that passes you
You know I’ll feel it like you do

The deeper I fall, the more I’m provoked without rest
I want to show you everything and give all the impact
Has it hit you yet? The more I get into your emotion
I can’t stop so I’m trusting the love that’ll hold and shake us

Your breathing gets rougher, as these motions follow
When we get closer baby, it keeps flickering
The more passionate we get, the more definitive we get
We want to feel each other even more, yeah

My left eye is blinking, like you, I hope your eyes will follow ma move
As if we’re becoming each other, each moment is so clear, every minute, every second

I’ll provoke all of your five senses so you can fall deeply into me
If you lay everything down and jump into this, it’ll be perfect
Has it hit you yet? The more you melt into the same feeling
There’s no need to stay away, trust yourself in the moments to come

Trust yourself in the moment
It provokes us so we can fall deeply

"
3,electric,"

I’m observing and analyzing you, you’re beautiful
Yeah I wanna know you more
You fall out of my predictions, so interesting
Yeah, I’m gonna dig into you

If our fingers touch
How would it feel like?

Electric, electric, such a deep and clear stimulation
I can’t even measure the amount
Deeply remaining in my cells of my body
This long and explosive reaction

This explosive reaction
Electric, electric

When I see you, my neurons activate
You’re an unexplored zone, a mystery inside curiosity
The only theory that I must reveal
I think I’ll get all evidence if I hug you

I feel hot, ecstatic and breath taken
Yeah, my hypothesis was correct
When your breath mixes with mine, what transformation will occur?

Electric, electric, such a deep and clear stimulation
I can’t even measure the amount
Deeply remaining in my cells of my body
This long and explosive reaction

I wanna know, you’re so special, I must check
Only you’re the experiment that’ll enlighten me

If I get more aggressive
Will everything go wrong?

Electric, electric, it ties around me so dimly
With no resistance, I closed my eyes
No other precondition can come into existence
That’s how sure I am of you

That’s how sure I am of you
With this electric feeling x 2

"
4,who-waits-for-love,"

I was looking for an echo that didn’t return
Walking for a long time, then I got lost
My steps have grown heavy
I don’t even know why we’ve grown so far apart

“Hello,” your short greeting
Becomes a long rainfall
Even an umbrella is too good for me
I’m sick with you like a cold

Who waits for love x2
I don’t blame you for leaving me
Who waits for love x2
It’s my problem for loving you

This fever won’t cool because the cold wind keeps blowing
I’m sick with you, I’m not getting better, it’s not easy to endure each day
I can’t measure the size of my heart with a scale
I can’t read the temperature of my heart with a thermometer
I’m gonna break down, only I’m miserable, I want to take you off of me, get off

“Hello,” your short greeting
Becomes a long rainfall
Even an umbrella is too good for me
I’m sick with you like a cold

Who waits for love x2
I don’t blame you for leaving me
Who waits for love x2
It’s my problem for loving you

I’m walking through dark times
But please come to me just once, yeah baby
With these lyrics that are like coughs
And this melody that’s like a monologue

If I see you again, will I be able to hug you?
With this body that’s frozen and about to break?
Your eyes and your warm voice
I long for it like crazy

Who waits for love x2
I don’t blame you for leaving me
Who waits for love x2
It’s my problem for loving you

One day, give me your hand too, turn around and look at me
Find me, just once
Find me, just once
I’ll wait so please come back

"
5,our-page,"

Can you feel it? We’re connected
By our hearts that are transparent like invisible string

When I stand again on the road we walked on together
There are five overlapping hands, tears and memories
It’s so clear, I don’t want to forget, I can’t forget

The pretty words you left behind become a poem, become a song
Our voices are flying, we know it’ll reach you wherever you are
If a star vanishes, will everything be forgotten?
I’m holding the precious you in my arms
I want to fill the pages of this story that isn’t over yet
Until the very end

I’ll say that I miss you
But it won’t fill up my empty heart tonight
We’re facing each other, we’re still the same
We’re still the boys who are dreaming

The pretty words you left behind become a poem, become a song
Our voices are flying, we know it’ll reach you wherever you are
If a star vanishes, will everything be forgotten?
I’m holding the precious you in my arms
I want to fill the pages of this story that isn’t over yet
Until the very end

May 25, 2008
Boys shining brightly
Like green waves of spring
That time will spread and flow forever

The pretty words you left behind become a poem, become a song
Our voices are flying, we know it’ll reach you wherever you are
If a star vanishes, will everything be forgotten?
I’m holding the precious you in my arms
I want to fill the pages of this story that isn’t over yet
Until the very end

"
6,i-say,"

It won’t work out, we can’t be together
No matter how many times you say that, I can’t hear you

Your dry lips look so sad
So I just closed my eyes
We can’t ever break up

I say love you, tell me everything
The meaning behind your tears
If you’re gonna leave like this, I’ll just close my eyes

It’s not time yet, we can be together
No matter how many times I tell you

I guess you can’t hear it, I guess you can’t see it
I guess this is it for you, I guess it can’t be helped

I say love you, tell me everything
The meaning behind your tears
If you’re gonna leave like this, I’ll just close my eyes

Wanna be here with you Tell me everything
I’ll be waiting, I’ll always be here
Even if I have to push time, I’ll have you in my arms again

It’s not time yet, we can be together

"
7,retro,"

Hey yeah I don’t know what it is but
This girl got me feeling all emotional
Let me tell you real quick

Like a faded denim jacket, there’s a feeling to you
Like old school songs that I used to like
As soon as I saw you, felt like I already knew you
As if I saw you somewhere, I kept looking at you

I like being introduced as something old, I just like it
Through my purple glasses, I’m gonna get ya, get ya
My love with you is retro, retro

Things that change too easily
Don’t remain as any kind of memory

Retro love, familiar feels, even if others don’t understand, we’re
You and me, me and you, the same emotional motional mo motional
Vintage, colored with a long time, a history that’s only for us
Retro love, familiar feels, the same emotional motional mo motional

Like music you don’t get sick of even after several times
Our value increases as time goes by
All of your heavy burdens, lay them down when you dance
Down baby down baby down down down baby

You’re too tight, loosen up, relax and move with me
Tonight, once again, let’s be like our childhood Barbie and Ken

We’re like a romantic couple from an very old film

Retro love, familiar feels, even if others don’t understand, we’re
You and me, me and you, the same emotional motional mo motional
Vintage, colored with a long time, a history that’s only for us
Retro love, familiar feels, the same emotional motional mo motional

As if time has stopped both you and me
We’re fixated on each other
Our faces show the same emotion
My heart is at peace when I see you
You got it, my body and my heart is pulled to your specialty

Retro love, familiar feels, even if others don’t understand, we’re
You and me, me and you, the same emotional motional mo motional
Vintage, colored with a long time, a history that’s only for us
Retro love, familiar feels, the same emotional motional mo motional

Yeah, today, we’re once again
Yeah et’s be like our childhood Barbie and Ken
Retro with feeling

"
8,drive,"

Driving along the road with no destination
The green lights are pulling me along
I can’t turn back, I’m captivated by you
Bad directions but good endings, it’s complicated
I’m drawing out a map subconsciously

The green light that calls out to me
Are you standing at the end? I’m turning around again
This purposely long direction, I think it’s wrong
But I’m only going toward you

The left side of the road is what I’m used to
Only one reason I go
Even if I have to go the opposite way of my heart
The only reason for it is you

After this milestone has been engraved
Where will I go next? Am I just a mere foreigner?
The afterimages that blow in through the window
Is it just a resemblance? Is it really you? I stop and turn around
Even if you’re not interested, I have no other way to go

The green light that calls out to me
Is there really an end? Or is it too late?
I’ve grown blind in this long tunnel
What’s at the end? I hope it’s you

The left side of the road is what I’m used to
Only one reason I go
Even if I have to go the opposite way of my heart
The only reason for it is you

Every day, I linger around you
So powerless but hoping to reach you

With each light and rough word, you control me, left and right
Though I shake my head
As if the handle is out of control, I’m going back to you
And you wrap around me

I don’t know why, I get lost and wander on every road in this world
But my destination is only one
When night comes, even on a road that isn’t a road
Only you stand there, clearly smiling

"
9,i-want-you,"

I’ve fallen into a white sea, a black melody spreads, it draws you out
The forgotten memory and broken up pieces of tears, I hope they will all rewind

Close your eyes oh na na na
I don’t care if it’s a dream, show yourself to me
I’m calling out to you oh na na na
After a long time, to that place once again

I want you, I hope you’ll come to me with a different ending than last time
I can’t let you go, I dreamed of this moment every day, I said I want you
I can’t let you go, I waited for this moment endlessly, I said I want you

In this blue scene, in this world, it’s just you and me
I know, just by looking into your eyes, I won’t let go of your heart
WIth the sweetly whispered songs, it’s you

When I wake up, oh na na na, my setting smile faces reality again
Once again, oh na na na, if only I could be locked into this dream

I want you, I hope you’ll come to me with a different ending than last time
I can’t let you go, I dreamed of this moment every day, I said I want you
I can’t let you go, I waited for this moment endlessly, I said I want you

The cup fill of memories overflows tonight, oh na na na
Cross the blurry lines of memories, come to me, cause I

I want you, even if the deeper feelings swallow me up like a wave
I can’t let you go, if I close my eyes once more, I’ll be by your side, I said I want you
Oh na na na x2
I can’t let you go, when I open my eyes tomorrow, I’ll be in your arms, I, I said I want you

"
10,undercover,"

My feet paddle so quickly underwater but my face is peaceful, you don’t know
Even though I’m always so busy before the curtains go up, in front of you, I’m acting cool

This secret event is under way without you knowing, not yet
I’m aiming for the right moment, so it’ll be too late once you realize

Just like the dark shadows seeps into the night
I’m digging into your conscious, inside you, undercover

No need for big action in this scene, if you felt something, some kind of love
Because sometimes, a small whisper is even stronger, I want more

This secret event is under way without you knowing, not yet
When it’s the right moment, you need to want me so much that you can’t handle it

Just like the dark shadows seeps into the night
I’m digging into your conscious, inside you, undercover

In the mirror, you are just like me
That harmony is our song
I’m still undercover but soon you’ll find out

This secret event is under way without you knowing, not yet
I’m aiming for the right moment, so it’ll be too late once you realize

I’m flowing, seeping into you
Digging into your empty spaces, in your heart, undercover

Just like the dark shadows seeps into the night
I’m digging into your conscious, inside you, undercover

Undercover
Can you see the unfamiliar me?

"
11,jump,"

Why do you keep shaking me up? Messing up me? Making my heart flutter?
Like the gentle spring breeze teasing me, you pass me by
I endured through such a long time, flowers have bloomed but why won’t it work?
When I’m pulled by the wind right now

I’m shaking my head, brushing it off, adjusting my heart
Strongly protecting my place once again
I need to keep enduring, so I’m closing my eyes when I’m feeling empty for no reason

Higher and higher, fly, under my feet is the ground
Oh yes, I feel free, I jump on you, jump on you

Going going drops, falling like rain drops, coolly coming back down
The wind is a rollercoaster, I jump on you, jump on you

I’m not falling, I’m not withering, I’m just changing
I’m turning into different things and keep moving forward
Why was it so hard? Why did I hesitate for so long?
To escape the eyes of others and following my heart

Taking off my feet from being tied up
Spreading out my imagination that I drew out for a while
The wind is blowing, I’m opening my eyes now when I breathe in

Higher and higher, fly, under my feet is the ground
Oh yes, I feel free, I jump on you, jump on you

Going going drops, falling like rain drops, coolly coming back down
The wind is a rollercoaster, I jump on you, jump on you

The weather’s too nice outside, I don’t want to be like this
Happiness is always close, probably between do or don’t

You got me got me jump
Got me got me jump, jump x2

Higher and higher, fly, under my feet is the ground
Oh yes, I feel free, I jump on you, jump on you

Going going drops, falling like rain drops, coolly coming back down
The wind is a roller coaster, I jump on you, jump on you

"
12,tonight,"

Miss you

Even the darkness rests tonight
I’m opening the dusty window
Feels like you’ve come (tonight)
I was listening carefully for a while
Through the blue light (I felt you come)
You’re still so beautiful

Sometimes, rough rain falls
Then it stops as if it never came
Then you naturally (look at me as if you’re smiling)

Here, I’ve left your spot empty tonight tonight tonight
Again, I’m drawing out your voice tonight tonight tonight
My heart is deeper, slowly spreading tonight, shining deeper blue
I’ve left your spot empty tonight

Feels like something’s missing today
Easily saying, don’t be sad, life is like that
Times like this, it’s no use, I’m so lonely
Curious if you’re thinking about me tonight but stop that

As much as I loved you deeply
I have no choice but to continue to love you
After a long dawn, as if I’ve been painting you all night
The shining stars hold out their hands toward you

You’ve always filled up my days so naturally
My days have resembled you
Some day, for you, I’ll gather my heart
And tell you everything

Here, I’ve left your spot empty tonight tonight tonight
Again, I’m drawing out your voice tonight tonight tonight
My heart is deeper, slowly spreading tonight, shining deeper blue
I’ve left your spot empty tonight

Feels like the darkness is still you
Warmly, cozily, wrapping around my shoulders
With you

Even after the long dawn passes, worry about that, the words that are too late
Like a lighthouse on small waves, I’m shining the light
Even after the long dawn passes, worry about that, the words that are too late
The small waves bring you like a miracle tonight

Here, I’ve left your spot empty tonight tonight tonight
Again, I’m drawing out your voice tonight tonight tonight
My heart is deeper, slowly spreading tonight, shining deeper blue
I’ve left your spot empty tonight

Drawing you out Tonight baby

"
15,wish-upon-a-star,"

I held tight onto this time
This moment that seemed would last forever
The break up that followed love
Pushes me out as if it was planned
You always smiled
My foolishness makes me think that you’ll still greet me
My love left for a faraway journey
Now it’s the end

When my tears (my tears)
Become starlight (following the memories)
And shine brightly over there
Maybe you’ll see from somewhere
So every night, I become the starlight and shine

Memories of wanting to find you
Give me hope that you might return
But my hopes can’t endure
I guess it’s really over

Traces that resemble you
Stop me (stop me)
They say it’s no use even if I wait

When my tears (my tears)
Become starlight (following the memories)
And shine brightly over there
Maybe you’ll see from somewhere
So every night, I become the starlight and shine

In the sky (resembles you)
The countless stars
They’re my longing of not being able to reach you

Tears hide the starlight

When my sadness (my sadness)
Become rain (with the memories)
And fall in your heart
Maybe you’ll come back to me
So today, I become rain and fall

"
16,beautiful-life,"

The alarm isn’t ringing
I’m alone again today
Can’t I see you
Next to me ever again?
You, who were like the dazzling weather (your appearance)
Your bright face
They are now parts of old memories
Saying I have one wish
In the picture on the table, you are smiling
Every day we kissed
And spent time together
But now it’s getting forgotten

Just one word, just one word (one word, just one word)
You can get angry and upset (just one word)
If I can go back I would hold your hand
So you wouldn’t look back
Please just one moment

Just one word, just one word
Just one word, just one word

You used to lay on my lap
You said the light
Was so beautiful
They’re not leaving my head

Out of the many people you shined the most
Everyone stared at you
The kiss on your red lips, your warm hands and feet
They won’t leave me

Just one word, just one word (one word, just one word)
You can get angry and upset (just one word)
If I can go back I would hold your hand
So you wouldn’t look back
Please just one moment

Just one word, just one word
Just one word, just one word

Your scent that comes over with the wind
Your cheek that I touch is so cold
I can’t believe it
I’m seeing you again
It’s a beautiful Beautiful Life

Hmm, hey
Oh
It’s a beautiful

Just one word, just one word (one word, just one word)
You can get angry and upset (just one word)

17,rescue,"

I don’t like the word love
You used to say
Oh girl
No one understood you
Only I knew those painful words
And the meaning behind them
It’s hard to say with words
These emotions are whirling around
Losing all my control
It started with you
And only you can end this heart
Save me
All I’ve got is you
And I’m so into
Now I can finally breathe
Girl you’re my
Dream come true
The criminal of the night is alive
Let me feel your body temperature
Baby you’re my Rescue
Only you can take me out
Only you can make my blood circulate
Only you are the way to being rescued
You’re my rescue, you’re my rescue
I’m running out of breath
On top of the blue ocean
I’m a lone drifting boat
I want you as if I’m thirsty
Oh baby, come here
Every place you touch
It’s mysterious, you make me soft
Losing all my control
My body gets hot
My lips get red
Like I’m born again
All I’ve got is you
And I’m so into
Now I can finally breathe
Girl you’re my
Dream come true
The criminal of the night is alive
Let me feel your body temperature
Baby you’re my Rescue
I’ll hold you tight
Only this place is safe
I wanna stay by your side
The way you are way
You are way you are
So this love won’t crumble
I won’t go anywhere
I wanna stay by your side
The way you are way you are
All I’ve got is you
And I’m so into
Now I can finally breathe
Girl you’re my
Dream come true
The criminal of the night is alive
Let me feel your body temperature
Baby you’re my Rescue
Only you can take me out
Only you can make my blood circulate
Only you are the way to being rescued
You’re my rescue, you’re my rescue

18,if-you-love-her,"

When he said to me
“I heard you are a good friend”
It hurt so much
I hated you but was jealous, you guys looked good
Who am I to be relieved?
I’d be sorry if I hated the person next to you
Because you look so happy next to him

If you love her
If you want her
More beautiful than flowers
You have to love her more
If you love her
If you need her
Tell her without holding back

If you love her
If you love her

I see a lot of sides of you
That I haven’t known before
I didn’t know that you could be so child-like
(I didn’t know)

You’re so pretty, it hurts, you’re so lovable
These feelings make me feel smaller
You became someone I cannot love
But you’re looking at me and smiling

If you love her
If you want her
More beautiful than flowers
You have to love her more
If you love her
If you need her
Tell her without holding back

If you love her
If you love her
If you love her

Oh yeah

If you love her
If you want her
Don’t ever let go
Of her hands (oh yeah)
If you love her
If you need her
Don’t give me a chance

If you love her
If you love her
Oh if you love her
If you love her

If you love her
(If you love her
If you love her)
If you love her (woo)
If you love her
If you love her

Woo woo woo woo woo woo woo

Just like each minute and each second are different
Day by day, you become new

Your love newly shines
Once again, I’m fallin, fallin for you (come here)

There’s a sound of a new light spreading into my world
A foreboding of something unusual
An unbelievably strong attraction
It feels like dreaming

21,lipstick,"

The coral light ocean
The dried rose petals
Everything is a gift for you
Color yourself with a beautiful color
Paint it several times
On your small lips, yeah
The moonlight scatters past the darkened lights
Shining on you, who quietly closes your eyes

I want your lipstick, your color
I want your lipstick, so beautiful, ooh baby
When your lips (Eh) shine (Eh)
I want to know your heart
So I’m approaching you

I want to see you colored with
The orange sun
The red sunset
I’m telling you
I dream of you
Filled with all the colors of the world
The moment I reach you, I close my eyes

The colors ecstatically spread as if I’ll go blind
(Oh beautiful)
Only you are the end of this dizzy feeling

I want your lipstick, your color
I want your lipstick, so beautiful, ooh baby
When your lips (Eh) shine (Eh)
I want to know your heart
So I’m approaching you

Oh I wanna give you
All the colors that fill up my heart
I’m confessing my love one by one
It’s all about you, baby
I’ll give my heart only to you

I want your lipstick, your color
(Lipstick baby)
I want your lipstick, so beautiful, ooh baby
When your lips (Eh) shine (Eh)
I want to know your heart
We become the same color (All over me yeah)

Uh, on top of your lips that drink up the moisture
The lipstick is on as if it’ll slip off (Tonight)
You look at me, then you close your eyes
They slightly tremble and a
Strange vibration comes into my heart
(I wanna kiss you baby)
Uh, we are sharing the same color
The color of this fluttering heart
Gets thicker with your red lips
We’re getting closer, our hearts are getting more sensitive

I can’t hold it in
(Hoo)
Give it to me, give it to me
Give it, give it to me yeah
(Hoo)
Give it to me, give it to me
Give it, give it to me yeah (I wanna kiss you baby)

22,shift,"

I saw you from the beginning
I was circling you at night
During all that time
I couldn’t catch you, you’re like air
It’s slowly crumbling down
The wall between you and me
It’s like a SHIFT in you and I
We feel the same thing, because it’s us
Come close
I see your heart
Just like this, with you
I wanna run away somewhere tonight
Your eyes are different
I feel the atmosphere getting special
You and me, we’re past the dimensions
We know something has started
I saw you from the beginning
I was circling you at night
During all that time
I couldn’t catch you, you’re like air
It’s slowly crumbling down
The wall between you and me
It’s like a SHIFT in you and I
We feel the same thing, because it’s us
Get it together (Oh)
Get it together (Oh)
Run away with me (With me)
The small world between us has changed
Let’s not rush
Girl, the choice is up to you (Uh)
Let’s never stop
We both know what we want
Oh
SHIFT in you and I
SHIFT in
SHIFT in
It’s slowly crumbling down
The wall between you and me
It’s like a SHIFT in you and I
We feel the same thing, because it’s us
Come close
I see your heart
Just like this, with you
I wanna run away somewhere tonight

25,one,"

The morning sunlight is like you
It might be a little childish, but I like it
If I’m by your side when you wake me up
I have nothing more to wish for
I want to see you
Don’t think that we can’t love because we’re young
Before it’s too late
Before I grow older, can you hold onto me?

I love you only, as much as the sky
You truly are the reason I live
I really, really, I want to hug you like crazy
We’re still going too fast, right?

Whenever I meet eyes with her
I wonder if the smile that grows on my face
Might reach a corner of your heart
I whisper into the beautiful ear
Inside of your uncertain heart
My feelings of love for you

I’ll be taking you
Girl, I know without you
Without you, I miss you
I’ll long for you forever
My feelings of desire and hope
My love that grows deep again
I can no longer hide them
You are me, girl

My heart will catch you and not let you go
Can you feel it as well?
Before, oh, it’s too late
Before I grow older, can you hold onto me?

I know that your heart
Cannot come by my side yet
Can I just call you my one?

Let’s all together one, two, three, let’s begin
You are my one, my everything
I really, really, I want to love you like crazy
I can do that now, right?
I really, really, I want to love you like crazy
I can do that now, right?
