30,welcome-back,"  Wait a minute, Listen Baby oh! Welcoming you back here For me, I’m still the same guy that hasn’t changed a single bit Except for the fact that I’ve realized how precious you are Except for the fact that I’ve fixed my selfish self a little But for that? I’m just the same like my broad chest Because I need to embrace you when you’re sad I held back from punching walls when I was angry Because you like guys with pretty hands  Seeing you again for a the first time in a while It feels like my heart that hurt for so long Is getting perfectly well again Your beauty and grace is still the same Although my life without you was really lacking I can’t explain it with words  How were you doing this while Who did you lean on when you were struggling I found that I couldn’t stand for anyone but you I mean I never went searching but There’s not another girl like you in the world, for real  It was really lonely, nothing was new Every day by day was really just boring What I want to say is thanks for coming back  Welcome back I’m glad you returned I’ll treat you better now Welcome back I really missed you Now will you take me into your arms? Your scent, your small motions All the way to your soft touches Welcome back I’m glad you returned Baby I’ll be different now  Because those words “time heals everything” Is a lie to ease your heart Saying that I’ve never regretted our goodbye That I felt better being alone, it’s all a lie Oh I was so lonely I was so bored every minute, every day  Even your nagging That I thought I didn’t need Those were days I missed even that Your face when you smiled for me Every song that I serenaded you with It just all seemed like nosie to me now Even if I didn’t know anything else Without you i was all meaningless Even my weekends were empty without you When I saw those evening sunsets I reminisced those days with you  It was really lonely, nothing was new Every day by day was really just boring What I want to say is thanks for coming back  Welcome back I’m glad you returned I’ll treat you better now Welcome back I really missed you Now will you take me into your arms? Your scent, your small motions All the way to your soft touches Welcome back I’m glad you returned Baby I’ll be different now  Oh girl I’m sorry Oh girl I was wrong I’m so pathetic, I’m honestly so useless, aren’t I? I know Girl why are you laughing Oh I see you aren’t really that resentful after all But still, thank you for coming back  Welcome back I’m glad you returned I’ll treat you better now Welcome back I really missed you Now will you take me into your arms? Your scent, your small motions All the way to your soft touches Welcome back I’m glad you returned Baby I’ll be different now  Woo woo woo woo woo woo Don’t act like you hate me, I see you smiling Woo woo woo woo woo woo I’ll treat you better, please don’t leave me Woo woo woo woo woo woo Weren’t definitly meant to be Woo woo woo woo woo woo Let’s take it slow, let’s last real long Welcome Back  "

Your scent, your small motions All the way to your soft touches Welcome back I’m glad you returned Baby I’ll be different now  Oh girl I’m sorry Oh girl I was wrong I’m so pathetic, I’m honestly so useless, aren’t I?

60,welcome-back,"  Wait a minute, Listen Baby oh! Welcoming you back here For me, I’m still the same guy that hasn’t changed a single bit Except for the fact that I’ve realized how precious you are Except for the fact that I’ve fixed my selfish self a little But for that? I’m just the same like my broad chest Because I need to embrace you when you’re sad I held back from punching walls when I was angry Because you like guys with pretty hands  Seeing you again for a the first time in a while It feels like my heart that hurt for so long Is getting perfectly well again Your beauty and grace is still the same Although my life without you was really lacking I can’t explain it with words  How were you doing this while Who did you lean on when you were struggling I found that I couldn’t stand for anyone but you I mean I never went searching but There’s not another girl like you in the world, for real  It was really lonely, nothing was new Every day by day was really just boring What I want to say is thanks for coming back  Welcome back I’m glad you returned I’ll treat you better now Welcome back I really missed you Now will you take me into your arms? Your scent, your small motions All the way to your soft touches Welcome back I’m glad you returned Baby I’ll be different now  Because those words “time heals everything” Is a lie to ease your heart Saying that I’ve never regretted our goodbye That I felt better being alone, it’s all a lie Oh I was so lonely I was so bored every minute, every day  Even your nagging That I thought I didn’t need Those were days I missed even that Your face when you smiled for me Every song that I serenaded you with It just all seemed like nosie to me now Even if I didn’t know anything else Without you i was all meaningless Even my weekends were empty without you When I saw those evening sunsets I reminisced those days with you  It was really lonely, nothing was new Every day by day was really just boring What I want to say is thanks for coming back  Welcome back I’m glad you returned I’ll treat you better now Welcome back I really missed you Now will you take me into your arms? Your scent, your small motions All the way to your soft touches Welcome back I’m glad you returned Baby I’ll be different now  Oh girl I’m sorry Oh girl I was wrong I’m so pathetic, I’m honestly so useless, aren’t I? I know Girl why are you laughing Oh I see you aren’t really that resentful after all But still, thank you for coming back  Welcome back I’m glad you returned I’ll treat you better now Welcome back I really missed you Now will you take me into your arms? Your scent, your small motions All the way to your soft touches Welcome back I’m glad you returned Baby I’ll be different now  Woo woo woo woo woo woo Don’t act like you hate me, I see you smiling Woo woo woo woo woo woo I’ll treat you better, please don’t leave me Woo woo woo woo woo woo Weren’t definitly meant to be Woo woo woo woo woo woo Let’s take it slow, let’s last real long Welcome Back  "
