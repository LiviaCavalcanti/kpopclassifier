Even when my nose tingles
Because of the cold wind, I feel good
A warm cup of milk
Wakes me up every morning
People at the bus station
They look at different places
Listening to different songs
I wonder if you know that
I’m thinking about you

Where is everyone going
So busily?
Who is the man next to me
Talking to on the phone?

Everyone’s so busy, so busy
Too busy
Me too, I’m so busy
Busy, thinking of you

My life is so beautiful
My life is so beautiful
Things may seem repetitive
But when I’m with you
They turn special

Beautiful
When I think about you
Whenever paradise
Paradise beautiful

When I hold your hand
Wherever paradise
Paradise beautiful

After a long day is over
I’ll be next to you
I will, for you
I will, for you

You rise up along
With the early morning sun
Reminding me of
Your warmth that falls down

I fell asleep in the night air
You entered my dreams
Without change
You wake me up on the next day

People on the streets
Either only walk forward
Or mind their own business
I wonder if you know that
I’m thinking about you

Where is everyone
Going so busily?
That couple over there
Why are they so happy?

Everyone’s so busy, so busy
Too busy
Me too, I’m so busy
Busy, thinking of you

My life is so beautiful
My life is so beautiful
Things may seem repetitive
But when I’m with you
They turn special

Beautiful
When I think about you
Whenever paradise
Paradise beautiful

When I hold your hand
Wherever paradise
Paradise beautiful

After a long day is over
I’ll be next to you
I will, for you
I will, for you

Paradise, all the things in front of our eyes
Touch, sight, hearing, taste
Although there are many withering flowers
Things here won’t wither
Our love will never rest

Beautiful
When I think about you
Whenever paradise
Paradise beautiful

When I hold your hand
Wherever paradise
Paradise beautiful

After a long day is over
I’ll be next to you
I will, for you
I will, for you

1,highlight,"

When the scattered pieces come together
Only then I can breathe
When the two lights face each other
Our tomorrows are revealed

When the sun sets and darkness comes
I only remember your warmth
Where the stars wrap around us
I’m going there, I’ll be there

I wanna match you to my heart
When dawn comes, like the sky and sunlight
We are resembling each other with time
In the end, we’ll become one

I’m like a bird, I’ll fly
Wherever I can hear your voice
In the air, wherever we are
When we face each other

To the depth of your eyes
Believe in this moment

Regardless of whether it’s day or night

Only in your line of vision
My lips can move
Let’s fill up the emptiness
With our expressions to give it meaning
Only we know this vide
You pull me over to somewhere

The reason for my existence is you
I wanna make you smile like the spring
Wherever we are, whatever we’re doing
We know it’s not important
We’re just pulled by each other’s eyes
Turn on the switch right now, brightly

I wanna match you to my heart
When dawn comes, like the sky and sunlight
We are resembling each other with time
In the end, we’ll become one

It remains in the footsteps
Wherever we are in the world

흩어진 조각들이 모일 때
비로소 난 숨을 쉬어
두 개의 빛 마주할 때
서로의 내일을 밝혀

해지고 어둠이 찾아올 땐
오직 난 너의 온도를 기억해
별들이 감싸 안고 있는 곳
그곳으로 가고 있어 I’ll be there

널 내 맘에 Match 하고 싶어
동틀 때 하늘과 햇살처럼
시간과 함께 우린 닮아가
결국에 하나가 될 우릴 봐

I’m like a bird 날아갈게
네 목소리 들리는 곳 어디든지
In the air 어디서든 우리

우리만 아는 Vide

내 존재의 이유는 너야
봄 같은 미소를 짓게 해주고파

서로가 어디서 무얼 하든지
중요치 않음을 잘 알고 있지
단지 바라보는 눈빛에 끌려
이 순간 밝히게 켜놓아 스위치

Although I can’t know when our end will be
Although I don’t know if something will come up and I won’t be able to come

Lean on me, on me, on me
Lean on me, on me, on me
Lean on me, on me, on me, lean on me

If I’m inside you, if I’m really in your heart
Wherever you go I will follow you
Even if we’re busy and can’t see each other often

We can get drunk on each other and fall asleep
Don’t hesitate and lean on me
We’re putting up with it well so cheer up
Even if we wake up from this dream if I’m really in your heart
Wherever you are I’ll be there
I’ll be there, I’m always in your heart
If it’s hard for the both of us we’ll work together even more My girl
Oh Girl, you’re the correct answer, on tough days hold my hand
I’ll pat your sagging shoulders sometimes
When you’re tired and it’s tough, come to me

Although I can’t know when our end will be
Although I don’t know if something will come up and I won’t be able to come

Lean on me, on me, on me
Lean on me, on me, on me
Lean on me, on me, on me, lean on me

You can lean on me, out your head on my shoulder
I’ll become your resting place even if just for a moment
You made me forget all the tough things
So I’ll empty my happiness here anytime
Who made you cry again? who was mean to you?

Tell everyone without exception
Even if your conversation is long we keep talking all night long
I’ll become your star, lean on my arms

I’ll be there, I’m always in your heart
If it’s hard for the both of us we’ll work together even more, My girl
Oh Girl, you’re the correct answer, on tough days hold my hand
I’ll pat your sagging shoulders sometimes
When you’re tired and it’s tough, come to me

Come to me I know that it’s so hard
You and I are just the same, we know it’s hard but
While looking at each other we’ve been walking slowly step by step
Why are you worrying? our end hasn’t come

Although I can’t know when our end will be
Although I don’t know if something will come up and I won’t be able to come

Yeah yeah yeah yay wo
You're going too fast baby
I do not know what's wrong baby
You're going too fast baby
Uh uh listen

I do not know why
Blushing each other's faces
We're not like before

Two hands together
There is no warmth at all
But why can not we let each other go
At the same time
We can not let go

Yo, S.COUPS
Walk ahead and look back
Let me clear the gap
I walk on my head
I'll take a step

Accompanied by familiarity
With boredom
More and more we are walking
I do not want to deny it to a long tunnel

Do not be gone too long
I'm going where I can not go
You and me who walked together
I can not find it now
You walk so quickly

You are walking fast
I can not guess
What can I do if I walk as fast as you do?
Far-away

You and me together uh
Going we're going
Going we're going
Going we're going ooh uh

You and me together uh
Going we're going
Going we're going
Going we're going ooh uh
You and me like this two going

In the hand holding it together
I do not have warmth
I have to let go
Now, why are we here now?
Do we have to be so sick of each other?

It's not fun
I can not wait to make an appointment
It's full of warmth
Everything is melted. Uh

Nevertheless
I do not want to spend so much time man
It is awkward to meet each other
Your steps are getting faster, why?

Do not be gone too long
I'm going where I can not go
You and me who walked together
I can not find it now
You walk so quickly

You are walking fast
I can not guess
What can I do if I walk as fast as you do?
Far-away
You and me like this

24/7 Walking away from each other
What can you do behind your back?
24/7 You are moving away
I can just let it go

You are walking fast
I can not guess
What can I do if I walk as fast as you do?
Far-away

You and me together uh
Going we're going

5,simple,"

I’m standing on the last road for today
It’s like this every day
In this big world
I know I’m like a particle of dust
Nothing is easy
In this exit-less, maze-like world
Happiness is only a word
It’s just a dream that everyone wants
But that doesn’t make sense
I don’t even wanna believe that
Yeah I just want it SIMPLE SIMPLE oh

Everything that makes me breathe
I want it to be simple
Until it goes far far away
Until I can’t see
I call you baby yeah
Baby’s called my happiness yeah
Yeah I just want it SIMPLE SIMPLE
I want it SIMPLE

Nothing is easy
In this exit-less, maze-like world

Happiness is only a word
It’s just a dream that everyone wants
But that doesn’t make sense
I don’t even wanna believe that
Yeah I just want it SIMPLE SIMPLE oh

Everything that makes me breathe
I want it to be simple
Until it goes far far away
Until I can’t see
I call you baby yeah
Baby’s called my happiness yeah
Yeah I just want it SIMPLE SIMPLE
I want it SIMPLE

Em I want it simple yeah
Even if everyone says I’m wrong
I hope we can all smile when the night is over

Everything that makes me breathe
I want it to be simple
Until it goes far far away
Until I can’t see
I call you baby yeah
Baby’s called my happiness yeah
Yeah I just want it SIMPLE SIMPLE
I want it SIMPLE
Oh I want it SIMPLE oh yeah

"
6,space,"

Can’t see the end, the questions continue
I ask myself again and again
If I can endure through these things
Then as if it’s nothing, I say, why can’t I?
Actually, it’s been really hard
The fact that there’s not a single person
Who will listen to my secrets that
I’ve been keeping makes me sad
This reality makes me cry
Can’t see the end
When I open my eyes in bed
I still haven’t come out of my gravity defying dream
Is it morning? Is it night? I don’t even know
As I wash away the haziness at the sink
But everything stays the same
I see myself in the mirror with
Several days worth of makeup
My skin is ruined and I feel like I lost my goal
The dark circles underneath just get deeper

Feels like I’m floating in space
I don’t know where to go
But the stars far away pull me
I Can Feel It, I Can Feel It
I feel like I can be a light

Can’t see the end
I ran all the way from the start without rest, but why
Where did my usual self go?
What am I chasing after every day?
I pray every day that it
Won’t be a lie
When I say I’m ok
But why are the expectations so high?
I wipe away the bursting tears
I think of my family and dream once again

Can’t see the end
Leave me alone
Actually, I’m miserable
After I finish a packed schedule
Expectations from friends and family
Follow me into bed
I can’t even close my eyes and sleep
I forgot how to go for it all
Now I have a habit of avoiding the little things
Can’t see the end, typical words “have strength”
It’s not the same as before
Why am I so desperate?

Feels like I’m floating in space
I don’t know where to go
But the stars far away pull me
I Can Feel It, I Can Feel It
I feel like I can be a light

Maybe what I want is over there at the end
Getting what I want will be harder than just
Determination
But I can’t be impatient
Anymore
If I’m lost again, I need to find it again

Feels like I’m floating in space
I don’t know where to go
But the stars far away pull me
I Can Feel It, I Can Feel It
I feel like I can be a light

So strongly that it can’t fall down

No reason to deny it
Don’t be scared

But they ain’t got no guts Dino

[Verse 5: Dino]
Repeats every day
Honing my skills, everything else is a waste of time
It’s too overwhelming to get any closer
A bit suffocating
Just as always, we get it done
And we killed

[Verse 6: DK, The8, Mingyu]
Bite all ten fingers
All of them would hurt
But just leave one special finger
To hold up for me

Everyone looks at me
Mini heart in the love

Stand toward the top
So everyone in front of me
Will look at me

8,pretty-u,"

[Intro: Wonwoo, All]
Seventeen~
Got so much to say
But can’t organize myself
Help me, S.O.S
1, 2, 3, 4

[Verse 1: Joshua, DK, Mingyu, The8, Vernon]
What kind of expression
Can deliver my heart?
Should I take my heart out to copy
And paste on you?

On one fine day
You magically appeared
You took my heart and attracted my eyes
You’re greedy

What I wanted to say is

Don’t take this the wrong way
But I can’t see anything but you
You’re so ice ice baby
At the same time you melt me down
Just can’t get enough
I want to show you myself without hiding anything

[Pre-Chorus: Seungkwan, Mingyu]
Oh, we chose each other and
Focus on by nano unit
When I see you, it’s breathtaking
Normally I’m not like this

[Chorus: Joshua, DK, Woozi, Jeonghan]
I want to pick and gather all
The pretty words for you
They stick in my
Throat in front of you

I promise myself, while drinking
A glass of water in the morning, to tell you
I will confess what has been
On the tip of my tongue tomorrow
You are pretty

[Verse 2: S.Coups, The8, Dino, Hoshi]
Pills for cold, meals for hunger
Me for you
I want to define you as me
Like this in the dictionary
By the way what should I do today?

Should I ask the internet?
What to wear, where to go
I should have studied hard like this

[Pre-Chorus: Seungkwan, Mingyu]
Oh we chose each other and
Focus on by nano unit
When I see you, it’s breathtaking
Normally I’m not like this

[Chorus: Joshua, DK, Woozi, Jeonghan]
I want to pick and gather all
The pretty words for you
They stick in my
Throat in front of you

I promise myself, while drinking
A glass of water in the morning, to tell you
I will confess what has been
On the tip of my tongue tomorrow
You are pretty

[Bridge: Jun, Dino, The8, Wonwoo, Seungkwan, DK]
I can’t take it no more
I’ve got something to say
I can’t take it no more
Right now, I’m gonna try
I can’t take it no more
I was about to write a letter
I can’t take it no more
I can’t stand it

Baby you’re my lady
I am running to your heart
Baby I’m almost there

[Chorus: Seungkwan, Woozi, Joshua, Jeonghan]
(Oh~) I promise myself, while drinking
A glass of water in the morning, to tell you
Beautiful words like the
Lines in a movie
The words I’ve prepared
Overnight for days
I want to say them to you tomorrow
With my clenched fists
You are pretty

[Outro: Vernon, S.Coups, Mingyu, Wonwoo]
Does she love me
Does she love me not
I am counting flower petals all day long

Does she love me
Does she love me not
What will the petals answer to me?

"
9,still-lonely,"

[Verse 1: Vernon]
Yeah, Uh
They’re like ocean waves
Am I going by the seasons, alone
Am I going by the seasons, alone

Yup uh
Man I’m livin' it
Every day is decent
Wherever I am all the kids
Follow around like ocean waves
When I’m switching the phone batteries
Messages are overflowing huh
It’s every day that I’m soaked in popularity
But my heart is about to wither

[Pre-Chorus: Hoshi/Dino]
As time goes by
My attitude towards everything is whatever
I’m sick of trivial hangouts
And conversations
I don’t like having to live up
To other people’s expectations
All of it just piles up
All the phone numbers I don’t call
Just pile up, pile up
It piles up when I don’t want it to

[Chorus: Woozi, DK]
This cursed popularity. Why won’t it go away
But why am I getting lonelier
Cold early morning wind Makes me
Even more lonely today
I feel empty, Like I am empty

[Post-Chorus: Jun, DK]
Am I going by the seasons, alone
Am I going by the seasons, alone – Am I going
By the seasons. Why am I talking to myself alone
I feel empty, Like I am empty

[Verse 3: Hoshi, Woozi]
There’s traffic because of my popularity
This is the life that other people want to live
But I’m still frustrated
What made me this way
One, two, four days pass. Time goes by
And I’m empty, I’m empty

[Pre-Chorus: Hoshi, Dino]
As time goes by
My attitude towards everything is whatever
I’m sick of trivial hangouts
And conversations
I don’t like having to live up
To other people’s expectations
All of it just piles up
All the phone numbers I don’t call
Just pile up, pile up
It piles up when I don’t want it to

[Chorus: Woozi/DK]
This cursed popularity. Why won’t it go away
But why am I getting lonelier
Cold early morning wind Makes me
Even more lonely today
I feel empty, Like I am empty

[Bridge: Wonwoo]
Ha my overflowing popularity is in direct contrast
To the empty house inside of my heart
My chest is puffed when I’m outside
And I slouch when I’m back home
I look into the mirror and see my pathetic self
Am I going by the seasons why am I so depressed by myself
Why am I depressed again why am I like this
Loneliness, like a dust Is caked on me

[Chorus: Woozi/DK]
Ah this cursed popularity. Why won’t it go away
(This cursed popularity- It won’t go away)
(It won’t go away)
But why am I getting lonelier
(But why am I)
Cold early morning wind Makes me
Even more lonely today
I feel empty, Like I am empty

[Post-Chorus: Jun, DK]
Am I going by the seasons, alone
Am I going by the seasons, alone – Am I going
By the seasons. Why am I talking to myself alone
I feel empty, Like I am empty

[Pre-Chorus: Hoshi/Dino]
시간이 갈수록 점점
매사에 나의 태도는 무덤덤
시답잖은 만남
대화도 지겹고
남의 눈에 맞춰
사는 것도 뭐 같고
그냥 쌓여가 쌓여가
연락도 안 하는 번호만
그냥 쌓여가 쌓여가
원하지 않아도 자꾸 쌓이는

[Chorus: Woozi, DK]
아 이놈의 인기 사라질 생각을 안 해
근데 왜 이리 점점 더 외로운 건지
쌀쌀한 새벽바람도
오늘따라 더 외롭게 만드는데
자꾸 텅 빈 것처럼 허전해지네

[Post-Chorus: Jun, DK]
그냥 혼자서 계절 타는 건지
그냥 혼자서 계절 타는 건지
자꾸 왜 혼자서 말을 하는 건지
자꾸 텅 빈 것처럼 허전해지네

[Verse 3: Hoshi, Woozi]
나 땜에 길이 막혀
이렇게 남부럽지 않게 사는데
답답한 건 여전해
뭐가 날 이렇게 만든 건데
하루 이틀 지나 나흘 시간은 가는데
텅 비어있어 텅 비어있어

[Pre-Chorus: Hoshi/Dino]
시간이 갈수록 점점
매사에 나의 태도는 무덤덤

근데 왜 이리 점점 더 외로운 건지
쌀쌀한 새벽바람도
오늘따라 더 외롭게 만드는데

[Bridge: Wonwoo]
하 넘쳐흐르는 인기랑 대조되는
내 속마음은 빈집
밖에서는 높아지는 어깨의 위치
집에서는 혼자 축 쳐져 있지
그러다 못난 내 모습이 거울에
계절 타는 건지 나 혼자 우울해
그냥 또 우울해 왜 이러는 건지
외로움이란 먼지가 내게 케케 묵었지

[Chorus: Woozi, DK]
아 이놈에 인기 사라질 생각을 안 해
(이놈에 인기~ 생각을 안 해~)
(생각을 안 해)
근데 왜 이리 점점 더 외로운 건지
(근데 왜 이리)
쌀쌀한 새벽바람도
오늘 따라 더 외롭게 만드는데
자꾸 텅 빈 것처럼 허전해지네

[Post-Chorus: Jun, DK]
그냥 혼자서 계절 타는 건지
그냥 혼자서 계절 타는 건지
자꾸 왜 혼자서 말을 하는 건지
자꾸 텅 빈 것처럼 허전해지네

10,hit-song,"

What song are you listening to?
Who is the singer?
Who do you like these days?
It changes with the weather and my feelings
The song you’re listening to
In your phone is good too but (Stop)
Listen to the song
I made for you today

The title is “Pop Song”
I want the song to get popular just like the title
Whatcha say, whatcha doing?
Just sing along for me

This is a pop song, this is a pop song
It must be that way, it has to be
Whatever you’re eating
This will make you think of me
This is a pop song, this is a pop song
Wherever I go, wherever I am
You will think of me

Pop song, pop song
Pop song, pop song
Pop song, pop song
Pop song, pop song, pop song

I know I’m not the best rapper
I’m not good at delivering words
But I got that something babe
I don’t want to show you so easily

People around you mmm
They hum lightly
I wrote down these lyrics every time I thought of you
This is for you

I hope that you listen to it seventeen times every day
I hope that you know which song it is
Like when the cherry trees blossom and the spring breeze blows
This is for you

The title is “Pop Song”
I want the song to get popular just like the title
Whatcha say, whatcha doing?
Just sing along for me
Yeah

This is a pop song, this is a pop song
It must be that way, it has to be
Whatever you’re eating
This will make you think of me
This is a pop song, this is a pop song
Wherever I go, wherever I am
You will think of me

Pop song, pop song
Pop song, pop song
Pop song, pop song
Pop song, pop song, pop song

I hope that this song is your morning alarm
When the evening dawn sets
I hope that this is the song that will accompany your feelings
Whenever wherever you’re meeting someone
Please don’t compare this song
To other songs that don’t have substance
It might sound funny but you have to listen
You HAVE to listen

This is a pop song, this is a pop song
Wherever I go, wherever I am
You will think of me

Pop song, pop song
Pop song, pop song
Pop song, pop song

11,say-yes,"

I want to see you
I wanted to see you so much
I know it’s not allowed
But I try to turn back time
I lean on one side of the room
And call your name Say Yes
But only your forgotten voice comes back
Oh you’re so pretty, you’re so so soft
If you still have those memories
That seemed so fragile

You say You say
This song
That you used to sing with me
When you’re alone at night I stay
I love you I love you
I’m always waiting for you like this
Tell me to just stay
You, Say Yes

Can you say Can you say
You became my light
Can you say
I couldn’t let you go
Even if I keep singing this melody
There is no response

Oh you’re so pretty, you’re so so soft
I couldn’t erase those memories
That seemed so fragile

You say You say
This song
That you used to sing with me
For the happy day, I pray
I love you I love you
I’m always waiting for you like this
Tell me to just stay
You, Say Yes

You say You say
This song
That you used to sing with me
When you’re alone at night I stay
I love you I love you
I’m missing you today like this
Tell me to just stay
You, say, You, say
I love you Say Yes

Yeah, say yeah ho

"
12,drift-away,"

Time goes by
I look back on today, it seemed too long
It was short but I didn’t realize it
All the things that I passed by
I want to see the beautiful memories
That can’t be turned back
Precious time flows from the watch on my wrist
Memories wash away and end up as a wide ocean
The past and the present flow the same way
But I have regrets about missed opportunities
Guess I’m still far from becoming an adult
Or no, I just don’t want to, guess I’m acting like baby
Unknown days keep washing down
Because I can’t hold on
I let the time take control and let it wash me away

All the trivial things that keep washing away
You’re already so far away inside
You who’d lean on me during hard times
Walking slowly and heavily
And then you became a part of my memories
Happiness oh oh and sadness oh oh
Am I wrong for hoping
That all of it would come back to me?

We are washed away, washed away
Washed away in this time
Washed away, washed away
We are washed away, washed away
Washed away in this time
Washed away, Washed away

If I look back hoping I would see you
I keep bumping into things in front of me
I get brused and hurt
I just can’t help it

Yeah
Out of countless words
The word “miss” somehow
Makes my memories even more real
But they wash away and the next thing comes to me
I will naturally adjust myself to the present
Within some memories there is pain or regrets
In another memory I have excuses for feeling bad
They cleanly wash away, and the only thing that’s left
Are happy feelings

All the trivial things that keep washing away
You’re already so far away inside
You who’d lean on me during hard times
Walking slowly and heavily
And then you became a part of my memories
Happiness oh oh and sadness oh oh
Am I wrong for hoping
That all of it would come back to me?

We are washed away, washed away
Washed away in this time
Washed away, washed away
We are washed away, washed away
Washed away in this time
Washed away, Washed away

I’m busy today like always
Wishing that the past
Will come back to me
Is nothing but a dream
Everyone’s busy like always
Wishing that the past
Will come back
Is nothing but a dream

When in the shade
Spread branches

My sorrow melts

15,our-dawn-is-hotter-than-day,"

Our night is countless
Between the stars and the sand
On the sound of a fireball that shoots firecrackers
Our laughing smile

Far away moonlight
Become our lights
Wind-blowing
When I am spreading from me to you
My tears are gone

It's gone
With both hands tightened
Fill the sky with stars
Shine on us

Until the sun rises ah
We keep burning ah
At this moment, with a smile
Batem Touch to you
Our dawn is hotter than day
Until morning

Oh Summer Summer
Summer Summer Oh
Carving us in the summer night
Oh Summer Summer
Summer Summer Oh
How about when I get back?

Oh Oh
What about then
Oh Oh Oh
What about then

Night All Sleep
Is it beautiful
Your smile with the moonlight
Shine a dark night
Laughter
Tickle your ears

All out
Into the wild
Do not meet their standards
This time
Our dawn is hotter
When the day is bright
The world is ours

That far away light
Being our memories
Full wave
In our writing we left it under
Carve each other's names

Our dawn is hotter than day
Until morning

Oh Summer Summer
Summer Summer Oh
Carving us in the summer night
Oh Summer Summer
Summer Summer Oh
How about when I get back?

Oh Oh
What about then

Laugh every day
Like now
Beautiful road

Our dawn is hotter than day
Until morning

My heart is hotter than day
As you are now

16,20,"

It’s still a boring morning
(Far away so far away far away so far away)
The distance between me and you has no progress
So far away (Far away so far away)
Do you still think of me as the person before?
In your small eyes
I’m probably still a kid
This isn’t the first time so what can I do?
I can’t get over
How you laugh in front of me
I can’t just stay still

I wanna be your morning baby
From now on, be alright
Spend it together, morning baby
I want u to be my night
Everything you think of
Will become all of me
Look at me and be my lady
You’re my twenties

Don’t try to brush past it like it’s nothing
If u want me yeah if u want me
I can give you my everything
If I’m in your heart

Without anyone knowing
I have changed
It’s mixed up baby
I’m mixed up into you lady
I didn’t know I’d be like this
Because it was always just a what if (You’re Oh)

Do you still think of me as the person before?
In your small eyes
I’m probably still a kid
This isn’t the first time so what can I do?
I can’t get over
How you laugh in front of me
I can’t just stay still

I wanna be your morning baby
From now on, be alright
Spend it together, morning baby
I want u to be my night
Everything you think of
Will become all of me
Look at me and be my lady
You’re my twenties

When you look at me, you’re so beautiful
I want to tell you
All of you that I see
I want to cherish it
Just come to me
I want you to want me baby

I wanna be your morning baby
From now on, be alright (until always)
I’ll show you how
I only think of you

Don’t try to brush past it like it’s nothing
If u want me yeah if u want me
I can give you my everything
If I’m in your heart

"
17,thanks,"

Wherever you were
If I could hear you, I would run to you without second thoughts
Back then, back then

My young heart was only so playful back then
When I see you smile, I felt something
Cuz I never learned any of this

I couldn’t express my feelings because I was too young
I wanted to be your tomorrow so I lived today
Ever since the first day I saw you until now

In my heart, it’s only you

These typical words
I’m only saying them now
But I hope these typical words
Will reach you

Thank you, thank you, that’s all I can say
Even all the waiting, the longing
And all of our memories

Thank you
Thank you

Because they’re such common words
I was worried it wouldn’t sound sincere
I was looking for something better than just thank you
So I couldn’t tell you thank you

I couldn’t express my feelings
Because I wasn’t brave enough
If only I knew love a little earlier
Ever since the first day I saw you until now

In my heart, it’s only you

These typical words
I’m only saying them now
But I hope these typical words
Will reach you

Thank you, thank you, that’s all I can say
How to wait and what love is
You taught me all

Thank you
Thank you

My heart won’t change, it won’t ever change
Even if you erase me
We won’t change
Because we’re engraved in each other’s hearts
(Engraved)

Thank you
Thank you

I hope this reaches you
This song
Thank you

Thank you

Even now, my eyes and mouth are full of you
A day passes and the regret is too deep
I’m drowning in it

If I didn’t let go of your hand then
Would we be still holding on to each other still
If I If I If I

Before your small scars gather and become big
If I had recognized them first
If I If I If I
If I If I If I

Where you going, where are you going
Why do I feel my grip loosening
My fist holding onto the edge of your clothes, why am I losing strength
Our path, our promise to be together
Is already thwarted and you walk away, turning your back on me

It reduces to a single dot
It’s too empty outside of that interest
I hope that that dot
Comes back before me and turns into you

If I could
If I could
If I could
I’ll do whatever

If we can walk this path together again
I want to hold your hands and give you warmth
If I hold your cheeks with warmed hands
Will you smile again for me
Then let’s do

I’ve fallen into you
I’m struggling because of you
My movements become slower
And I’m starting to suffocate
I’m a swimming fool

I want to not think of you sometimes
I think I’m gonna go crazy when I think of you

But it’s not as easy as
It’s easier said than done
Whatever La lala lalalala

Hit me hit me up
Ring ring ring ring I call
My mouth curls
The moment I pick up my mouth curls
When you want to hear about my heart
Throw your hands up
Throw your hands up
Throw your hands up

I’ve fallen into you
I’m struggling because of you
My movements become slower
And I’m starting to suffocate
I’m a swimming fool

Tantalizing feel that soaks from the tip of my toes
I twitch once
The heart dances, badum tss
I throw my body, I’ve fallen for you Stupid
I’m always soaked in this feeling
The light shining because of you is hot
I want to keep swimming
We are always tied together, tightly

Hit me hit me up
Ring ring ring ring I call
My mouth curls
The moment I pick up my mouth curls
When you want to hear about my heart
Throw your hands up
Throw your hands up
Throw your hands up

I’ve fallen into you
I’m struggling because of you
My movements become slower
And I’m starting to suffocate
I’m a swimming fool

I’ve fallen into you
I’m struggling because of you
My movements become slower
And I’m starting to suffocate
I’m a swimming fool

The low-hanging sky
I’m still looking at over and over again (looking)
When I feel like nothing
That’s when I think of you
Just things like that inside (inside)
Drifting across your heart
I can never let go of
I know i’m still a child now
I can’t catch up to you yet
Only a little while more

As more time pass, When I grow up
I’ll understand you more
My love my love my love, my dear
Don’t you dare let loose of my hands

When I grow up, Things I think will change
Everything, everything
Is going to follow me, will only hurt my head
When I grow up

When I grow up
When I grow up
Only that phrase is stuck in my head
It’s making me dizzy
Making me dizzy, to understand your everything
Might take alot of my energy

Just things like that inside (inside)
Drifting across your heart
I can never let go of
I know i’m still a child now
I can’t catch up to you yet
Only a little while more

As more time pass When I grow up
I’ll understand you more
My love my love my love, my dear
Don’t you dare let loose of my hands

Woah~ woah~
I’m waiting just for u
I’m waiting for you, I’m not losing you
That is why, I’m still here

When I grow up Things I think will change
Everything, everything
Is going to follow me, Will only hurt my head
When I grow up

Just You
Only you can rock my world
Just You
Only you can be the reason for my pain (B B Baby)
As if digging in the clouds
My heart is floating lighty
Everything starts with you
So you should end it

The pain that feels good continues
Driving me to the edge, making me more dizzy
By the time i think i caught you i had lost you again
My whole body stiffens, only my eyes kept chasing you

I only use one word to unlock the door to your feelings
When i don’t have the key, sweet words place second
I study you constantly
And repeat the study every day
I’ll show you what I’ve done Rock my head

Yeah Just right now Everything has stopped
My body stiffens as I look at you
Yeah Just right now Feelings that became intense
So dangerous I cannot hide

Rock my head Rock my head
Rock my head Rock my head girl
Rock my head Rock my head
Rock my head (Rock Rock Rock Rock)
Rock my head Rock my head
You take me to the top and
Straight down like a gyro drop
Rock my head Rock my head
Rock my head (Rock Rock Rock Rock)
Rock my head Rock my head
You take me to the top and
Straight down like a gyro drop

I hope and hope more at everything
Only you can control me
What kind of disease is this

Intoxication seems to fall
Into a deep night Baby
Awaking and senses becoming more sensitive
The feeling is digging in deeper and deeper

Yeah Just right now Everything has stopped
My body stiffens as I look at you
Yeah Just right now Feelings that became intense
So dangerous I cannot hide

Rock my head Rock my head
Rock my head Rock my head girl

You take me to the top and
Straight down like a gyro drop
Rock my head Rock my head

You take me to the top and
Straight down like a gyro drop

Getting caught in your wide ocean
I think I’ve lost
Several times a day because of you
My head is bombarded, there is no space
I’m trying to forget you
But the thought of you are blocking my view
I’m walking aimlessly on the street called “You”

Rock my head Rock my head
Rock my head (Rock Rock Rock Rock)
Rock my head Rock my head
You take me to the top and
Straight down like a gyro drop
Rock my head Rock my head
Rock my head (Rock Rock Rock Rock)
Rock my head Rock my head
You take me to the top and
Straight down like a gyro drop

Ayo ayo
Seventeen Yob! You Know What?
These days, I have a lot of thoughts
These days, I have so much to tell you (these days)

I feel weird, I’m not talking as much
My friends are all worried (these days)
My heart races only when I’m in front of you
So I’m sorry about my clumsy actions

I still can’t control it
Please don’t play with me
Why are you keeping a front?
I don’t know, I don’t know what will happen

So what I mean is, I want to know all of you
I’ll sing you, U Hoo, I’ll sing you, U Hoo
Even if my lips are dry, I need to say this baby
I adore you, I adore you, enough to get dizzy

(Adore you) these days. I (these days)
(Adore you) these days, I (these days)

How can you dazzle so much?
You’re so pretty it’s selfish but your personality
Is so humble – This is not the place to joke around
I’m announcing the fact about your charms
Is it because I like how you smile at me?
Or do I just seem light to you?

Yeh, if you’re finding a spot
Yeh, right next to me is good
Yeh, I have a lot of interest in you
Even your shoe size oh oh

I’m on fire right now because of you
It’s impossible to cool me down
I’m on fire right now because of you
I don’t know, I don’t know, it’ll happen somehow

So what I mean is, I want to know all of you
I’ll sing you, U Hoo, I’ll sing you, U Hoo
Even if my lips are dry, I need to say this baby
I adore you, I adore you, enough to get dizzy

(Adore you) these days. I (these days)
(Adore you) these days, I (these days)

You can lean right here
You can cover your pain with me

Tell me your feelings
Don’t hold back, it’s not enough
Can’t fake it no more
Crank up the speed
Stop playing hard to get
Now let me call you

Baby you’re my angel, I want to know all of you

Even if my lips are dry, I need to say this baby
I adore you, I adore you, enough to get dizzy

25,ah-yeah,"

(Ah yeah, ah yeah, but what did you say?
Yo $. Coup$, Here’s the baton, Man)
Right when I appear, all the underlings drool
And faint  – And I’ll swim in that
Woah, all the kids that couldn’t float with their fat tubes
There’s no way they know, they don’t know why
They won’t succeed1 – I have no thoughts to adjust
To them so don’t try to fit me into your thoughts
I’ll nail your ears so hard
That you won’t be able to come outside
Just like that, you’ll always be behind us
It’s not even a royal flush
Don’t need to see it, just need to hear it once

It’s the start line, tie your laces tight
The distance between us and #1 is not far
We’ll take off the sand bags
That dragged us down
Get ready, crouch down (and run)
From last place, we became 2nd place
I wanna be #1 from this tight race
Don’t wanna be popular without a plan
Wanna fill up
Many ears with our stories (pull up)

Hold up, this feels a bit heavy
After we steal all eyes, we’ll jump around lightly
Turnt up I don’t give a
What What What What What
What you gonna say

Ah yeah, but what did you say?
I don’t really know anything
Ah yeah, I don’t understand
Tell me one more time, yes you

Vernon yeah Pull up on you wacks
With a Mac fully loaded ah
Pour down like monsoon season
Beehives increase and block my vision, wow
They don’t even know what they’re saying
All those barking rabid dogs (bow wow)
I hope you’ll be healed with this verse
Cause I’m the vet You know it

Hold up, this feels a bit heavy
After we steal all eyes, we’ll jump around lightly
Turnt up I don’t give a
What What What What What
