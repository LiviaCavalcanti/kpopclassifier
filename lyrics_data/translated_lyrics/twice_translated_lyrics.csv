My friend can't stay anymore
I can't lie to your heart
If you feel the same way
Let's step on together

[Pre-Chorus 1: Chaeyoung, Dahyun, Tzuyu, Jeongyeon]
Yeah, it's not good to waste my time
I feel like I want to be straight but I don't feel comfortable
But I will give courage and tried
If I liked and smile gently
Baby everything's gonna be alright

[Chorus 1: Jihyo, Tzuyu, Nayeon]
Gimme Gimme More

Next to the breeze so good, I want to look into you I wanna look
Through the clouds the result is higher wonder at this point

It's not enough twice, give me a hug once
I love listening twice
Miracles spread among the hands we connected
Throbbing me doesn't stop Baby in my heartbeat

Nanana nanana
You and me in the moonlight
A night of stars, flowers and festivals
The sound of the waves is on and we’re dancing right now
This feels so perfect

Hey ocean, come play with us
Hey wind, come over here
Under the moonlight, it’s our world
Everyone together, party all night long, yeah, it’s good

If you wanna have some fun
Don’t let go of this special happiness
That’s like the salty air
One two three, let’s go
Let’s go dance like flying to space
Hey! Let’s dance the night away

Let’s dance the night away
One two three, let’s go
Scream so loud they can hear you across the ocean
Let’s dance the night away
Dance the night away
Let’s dance the night away
Dance the night away
Let’s dance the night away

You and me in this cool night
The half-moon is smiling
Let’s promise to go behind the moon some day
And throw a party, yeah it’s good

If you wanna have some fun
Don’t let go of this special happiness
That’s like the silver sand
One two three, let’s go
Let’s go dance like flying to space
Hey! Let’s dance the night away

Let’s dance the night away
One two three, let’s go
Scream so loud they can hear you across the ocean
Let’s dance the night away
Dance the night away
Let’s dance the night away
Dance the night away
Let’s dance the night away

Shout as if today is the last, far far away
Jump as if you’re flying, higher and higher
Shout as if today is the last, far far away
With the spilling starlight, let’s dance the night away

Let’s dance the night away
One two three, let’s go
Scream so loud they can hear you across the ocean
Let’s dance the night away
Dance the night away
Let’s dance the night away
Dance the night away
Let’s dance the night away
