So Beautiful Beautiful You’re more beautiful than anyone else So don’t be sick, don’t cry If you can hear this song for you Come back to me Oh I miss you, I miss you Seeing myself standing alone in the mirror It’s strange and I’m afraid, I need you I hate myself for realizing this now Come back to me Memories are like a big garage like the ocean I am be lost in them all day Even this loneliness that I’m feeling Are traces of you So I force my eyes shut and am enduring through this day I miss you so much Now I finally feel our space I miss you so much Tears are falling like this But why didn’t I know?
