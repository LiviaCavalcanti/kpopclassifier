Our night is countless
Between the stars and the sand
On the sound of a fireball that shoots firecrackers
Our laughing smile

Far away moonlight
Become our lights
Wind-blowing
When I am spreading from me to you
My tears are gone

It's gone
With both hands tightened
Fill the sky with stars
Shine on us

Until the sun rises ah
We keep burning ah
At this moment, with a smile
Batem Touch to you
Our dawn is hotter than day
Until morning

Oh Summer Summer

Carving us in the summer night
Oh Summer Summer

How about when I get back?

Oh Oh
What about then
Oh Oh Oh
What about then

Night All Sleep
Is it beautiful
Your smile with the moonlight
Shine a dark night
Laughter
Tickle your ears

All out
Into the wild
Do not meet their standards
This time
Our dawn is hotter
When the day is bright
The world is ours

That far away light
Being our memories
Full wave
In our writing we left it under
Carve each other's names

Our dawn is hotter than day
Until morning
