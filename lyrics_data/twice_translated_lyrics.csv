Ah-ooh-ah, sweet talker

아주 달콤한 말로 날 유혹했지
너의 맑은 눈은 날 설레게 했지
그래 그렇게 다가와 줘 내게

친구들은 아니라고 날 말리네 (아 왜)

하늘처럼 맑다던 니 말
아무 감정 없던 너의 말
이제서야 알아챘어 난
몰라 아 몰라

영화 속 주인공이 된 것 같았지
해피엔딩이 난 좋았는데
그래 그렇게 물거품이 됐지

어떤 애인지 이제는
다 알게 돼버렸지만
슬퍼하지 마 괜찮아
너 같은 사람 꼭 만나

좋은 걸 어떡해 정신 못 차려

5,turtle,"
At first, I didn’t feel anything
Every day, we argued
But I guess we didn’t hate each other
Sometimes, when you stare at me
I’m afraid things’ll get awkward
So I just stare at the floor

I know you like me
But did you know?
I think I like you a little more
I mean it, my heart goes faster than you
Oh no Oh no Oh no, always

Always by my side
Will you stay?
Who cares if you’re slow?
I’ll wait for you

My heart grows like a balloon
I’m afraid it’ll burst
My heart keeps doing that
Whenever I see you

Like the hare and tortoise

You look even more handsome these days
Whenever you don’t call me
I get upset for no reason
Am I being too forward?
Whenever I feel impatient
I keep whining for no reason

I know you like me
But did you know?
I think I like you a little more
I mean it, my heart goes faster than you
Oh no Oh no Oh no, always

Always by my side
Will you stay?
Who cares if you’re slow?
I’ll wait for you

My heart grows like a balloon
I’m afraid it’ll burst
My heart keeps doing that
Whenever I see you

I’m in love with you
Please hurry
There’s so much we have to do

Always by my side
Will you stay?
Who cares if you’re slow?
I’ll wait for you

My heart grows like a balloon
I’m afraid it’ll burst
My heart keeps doing that
Whenever I see you

My heart always goes ahead
Like the hare and tortoise

6,missing-u,"

Don’t go, don’t go, I said back then
For the first time in my life, it was so not me
I cried and was clingy
Now night after night
Even after dawn
I’ll stay up thinking about you

Tonight, I miss you oh
I wanna see you oh
I don’t want anyone else but you
Tonight, I miss you oh
I wanna see you oh
I wanna touch you, hold you
You are my everything

Baby I’m missing you
Missing you
I don’t need anything else but you
Baby I’m missing you
Missing you
You left me here baby
Where did you go?

No No No No Baby
Where did you go?
No No No No Baby
Where did you go?

Sometimes, I tried to forget you
Like you don’t even exist
But every night, I dreamed
Waking up every hour
My heart gets sad
And my head keeps hurting

Tonight, I miss you oh
I wanna see you oh
I don’t want anyone else but you
Tonight, I miss you oh
I wanna see you oh
I wanna touch you, hold you
You are my everything

Baby I’m missing you
Missing you
I don’t need anything else but you
Baby I’m missing you
Missing you
You left me here baby
Where did you go?

I don’t like the saying
This is it
I tell myself this is all a dream
I can’t believe this is real
Wake me up and hold me again

You promised me
And I foolishly believed
But when you left, you had no guilt
But still I miss you
Miss you baby

Baby I’m missing you
Missing you
I don’t need anything else but you
Baby I’m missing you
Missing you
You left me here baby
Where did you go?

No No No No Baby
Where did you go?
No No No No Baby
Where did you go?

7,wow,"

Oh My God
My cheeks are too hot
My heart keeps pounding
My deeply hidden heart
Tickles so I frown without knowing
Oh My God

All day, I feel strange
This is what having butterflies feels like, right?
I got a feeling, it was you
What do I do? I think I fell for you

You pop like carbonated water
Making my heart pound
You drive me crazy, so fresh
What if you find out how I feel?
Even my voice became half a pitch higher

Oh my, so amazing
Wow Wow Wo Wow Wow
Whenever I see you, my heart keeps going
My head is going crazy already
I’m with you, just us two

What to do? Oh My God, only look at me
Only you don’t know, Oh My God
What to do? Oh My God, only look at me
Only you don’t know, Oh My God

I have a question, why are you so hot?
Even your personality is cool, you freeze me up
You have that twist, your eye smile confuses me
You look like you came straight
From a romance anime

All day, I’m thinking about you, curious about you
I can’t hold it in
I miss you, I wanna know you
What to do? I think it’s love

All my boring feelings have been erased
Like magic, all at once
Wherever I go, it’s obvious
Even if I don’t say it
I’m smiling

Oh my, so amazing
Wow Wow Wo Wow Wow
Whenever I see you, my heart keeps going
My head is going crazy already
I’m with you, just us two

What to do? Oh My God, only look at me
Only you don’t know, Oh My God
What to do? Oh My God, only look at me
Only you don’t know, Oh My God

The moment I first saw you, lucky
I knew right away it was you
Even your face looked happy
Tell me your hidden confession

It’s sweet, your face, even your eyes
What do I do? It’s like a lie
This feels like a dream
Electric, electric

I’m really going crazy
Wow Wow Wo Wow Wow
I miss you, I keep getting attracted to you
I want to know your heart too, really
Now, just us two

What to do? Oh My God, only look at me
Only you don’t know, Oh My God
What to do? Oh My God, only look at me
Only you don’t know, Oh My God

Breathing in the same place
Our memories are resembling each other one by one
And all day
At the end of the day, you’re there

My heart is at peace
Every time I breathe
I want to place you softly in my arms

13,ice-cream,"

Every day, my time with you isn’t enough
I was sad again today so I hid my heart
Stay with me a little more
I wanted to say but I couldn’t

More than anything else you’ve seen
I wanna show you my heart
I hope you know just that
I don’t expect anything else

Oh baby
Are you waiting for me?
Do you miss me?
I’m only thinking about what you like
What do I do?

Melt me, sweeter than ice cream baby
With your words, your smile
Softly melt me
I’m only looking at you
Tell me you love me

Melt me, sweeter than ice cream
I hear your voice
Be my butterfly that looks for a scented flower

After we spend a day together
After a day passes, I hope we can stay together longer
Only sadness remains
I hope you don’t feel differently

Oh baby
Are you waiting for me?
Do you miss me?
I’m only thinking about what you like
What do I do?

Melt me, sweeter than ice cream baby
With your words, your smile
Softly melt me
I’m only looking at you
Tell me you love me

Melt me, sweeter than ice cream
I hear your voice
Be my butterfly that looks for a scented flower

Just us two
Only in your arms
I always want my heart to flutter
Do you know?

Melt me, sweeter than ice cream baby
With your lips, with your touch
I can only see you
Close your eyes
I’ll tell you I love you

Melt me, sweeter than ice cream
I hear your voice
Be my butterfly that looks for a scented flower

14,signal,"
[Intro 1: Dahyun. Chaeyoung]
Trying to let you know
I send you a sign, send you a signal
I must let you know
I send you a sign, send you a signal

[Intro 2: Dahyun, Chaeyoung]
I send you a sign, send you a signal
I must let you know
I send you a sign, send you a signal
But it doesn’t work at all

[Bridge: Momo, Mina]
I give you a glance and keep throwing hints
But you don’t understand
You really get me so frustrated
I really don’t know why
Once again I gather up the courage
I send you a sign, send you a signal

[Verse 1: Jeongyeon, Chaeyoung]
No matter what glance, gesture or expression I give
It’s no use, nothing works
You just don’t get it, do you
What more can I do to express how I feel

[Pre-Chorus: Jihyo, Nayeon]
Didn’t realize it at first, but
At some point I started to like you, silly
How could you be so unaware
When will you stop being so obtuse
Treating me only as a friend
That is not what I want

[Chorus: Tzuyu, Sana]
I send you a signal, send you a signal
Tingling Tingling Tingling Tingling
I want you, I want you
Why won’t you respond
Whenever I see you, I send you my heart
Tingling Tingling Tingling Tingling
I’m waiting for you, it’s all so obvious
Why don’t you understand

[Hook: Dahyun, Chaeyoung]
Trying to let you know
I send you a sign, send you a signal
I must let you know
I send you a sign, send you a signal

[Verse 2: Jeongyeon, Mina]
When I smile at you, you really ought to know
It happens too often to be a coincidence
When I keep talking to you, you really should notice
How I keep on hanging around you

[Pre-Chorus: Jihyo, Nayeon]
Didn’t realize it at first, but
At some point I started to like you, silly
How could you be so unaware
When will you stop being so obtuse
Treating me only as a friend
That is not what I want

[Chorus: Tzuyu, Sana]
I send you a signal, send you a signal
Tingling Tingling Tingling Tingling
I want you, I want you
Why won’t you respond
Whenever I see you, I send you my heart
Tingling Tingling Tingling Tingling
I’m waiting for you, it’s all so obvious
Why don’t you understand

[Post-Chorus: Jeongyeon, Jihyo, Sana, Nayeon]
Tingling Tingling Tingling Tingling
Why won’t you respond
Tingling Tingling Tingling Tingling
Why don’t you understand

[Bridge: Momo, Mina]
I send you a sign, send you a signal
But it doesn’t work at all
I give you a glance and keep throwing hints
But you don’t understand
You really get me so frustrated
I really don’t know why
Once again I gather up the courage
I send you a sign, send you a signal

16,cheer-up,"
[Verse 1: Nayeon, Mina, Sana]
The bell bell bell rings every day
Please be considerate for me from now on
I don’t want to waste my battery
I keep looking at my phone and messages keep on coming
I feel like my phone is going to explode

I don’t know I don’t know, he can’t breathe
He’s having a hard time because of me
His heart drops when he sees me why
He says that I’m so pretty
I’m not trying to brag

[Pre-Chorus: Tzuyu, Sana, Mina, Momo, Jeongyeon]
Oh I’m sorry for not picking up earlier
I was seeing some friends that’s why I was shy shy shy
It’s not a good time for me to meet sorry
I’ll call you later in a little bit
Don’t pester me, I’m not gonna put up with it for long
I’ll let you call me Baby
It’s a little too soon, It’s a little soon for my feelings
But I will show you more

[Chorus: Jihyo, Nayeon]
CHEER UP BABY
CHEER UP BABY
Cheer up
Women shouldn’t easily hand over their hearts
That’s how you will like me a even more
I will act like nothing’s up
So that you won’t know that I have feelings for you
Just get it together
And then baby CHEER UP
(I need you)

[Verse 2: Chaeyoung, Dahyun]
I can hear your restless voice all the way from here
I can see the sweat-soaked phone all the way from here
It’s not attractive to reply right away
It’s normal that I read the message and not go in and check

Uh oh was I too harsh boy
I’m worried that you might get tired if I keep this up
Uh oh if I stop this I might
Fall for you, fall for you

[Pre-Chorus: Tzuyu, Sana, Momo, Jeongyeon]
I was seeing some friends that’s why I was shy shy shy
It’s not a good time for me to meet sorry
I’ll call you later in a little bit
Don’t pester me, I’m not going anywhere
I will be your Baby
I don’t like it when it’s too fast, show me that you are sincere
But I will wait for you

[Chorus: Jihyo, Nayeon]
CHEER UP BABY
CHEER UP BABY
Cheer up
Women shouldn’t easily hand over their hearts
That’s how you will like me a even more
I will act like nothing’s up
So that you won’t know that I have feelings for you
Just get it together
And then baby CHEER UP
(I need you)

[Bridge: Mina, Nayeon, Jihyo]
I’m scared you’ll find out how I feel about you
Come closer to me just as you are now
It’s not gonna take too long
Just get it together
And then baby, cheer up

Be a man, a real man
Gotta see you love me

[Verse 1: Nayeon, Mina, Sana]
매일 울리는 벨벨벨
이젠 나를 배려해줘
배터리 낭비하긴 싫어
자꾸만 봐 자꾸자꾸만 와
전화가 펑 터질 것만 같아
몰라 몰라 숨도 못 쉰대
나 때문에 힘들어
걍 심장이 떨어진데 왜
그애 말은 나 너무 예쁘대
자랑 하는건 아니고

[Pre-Chorus: Tzuyu, Sana, Mina, Momo, Jeongyeon]
아 아깐 못 받았어 미안해
친구를 만나느라 shy shy shy
만나긴 좀 그렇고 미안해
좀 이따 연락할게 later
졸라지마 얼마 가지 않아
부르게 해줄게 baby
아직은 좀 일러 내 맘 같긴 일러
하지만 더 보여줄래

[Chorus: Jihyo, Nayeon]
Cheer up baby, cheer up baby
좀 더 힘을 내
여자가 쉽게 맘을 주면 안돼
그래야 니가 날 더 좋아하게 될걸
태연하게 용기할래 아무렇지 않게
내가 널 좋아하는 맘 모르게
Just get it together
And then baby, cheer up
(I need you)

[Verse 2: Chaeyoung, Dahyun]
안절부절 목소리가 여기까지 들려
땀에 젖은 전화기가 여기서도 보여
바로바로 대답하는 것도 매력 없어
메세지만 읽어 확인 안 하는 건 기분
여 여 너무 심했나 Boy
이러다 지칠까 봐 걱정되긴 해요
여 여 안 그러면 내가 더
빠질 것만 같어 빠질 것만 같어

[Pre-Chorus: Tzuyu, Sana, Momo, Jeongyeon]
아 답장을 못해줘서 미안해
친구를 만나느라 shy shy shy
만나긴 좀 그렇고 미안해
좀 이따 연락할게 later
조르지마 어디 가지 않아
되어줄게 너의 baby
너무 빨린 싫어 생기를 더 보여
내가 널 기다려줄게

[Chorus: Jihyo, Nayeon]
Cheer up baby, cheer up baby
좀 더 힘을 내
여자가 쉽게 맘을 주면 안돼
그래야 니가 날 더 좋아하게 될걸
태연하게 용기할래 아무렇지 않게
내가 널 좋아하는 맘 모르게
Just get it together
And then baby, cheer up
(I need you)

[Bridge: Mina, Nayeon, Jihyo]
나도 네가 상처 입을까 봐
걱정되지만 여자니까 이해해주길
And then baby CHEER UP
속마음 들킬까봐 겁이 나
지금처럼 조금만 더 다가와
글이 오래 걸리진 않아
Just get it together
And then baby, cheer up
